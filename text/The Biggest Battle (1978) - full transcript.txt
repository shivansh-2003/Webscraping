If we succeed, we will have cut the Germans in both! Leaves no possibility their escape. Generals Patton, there are rumors that the General Montgomery has a secret strategy. No, Colonel, do not think so. The Monty will attack under the plan. By air, initially. Then with the heavy artillery... ... and finally attacks will covered by smoke curtain. I think the Germans will remember for long... This time we have something new. I want to go here a group of tanks. And to find the back of the Germans... is a very good idea.

We can stay here for months... ... and yet I will not have anything to say . How could I admit something I do not? How can I admit categories that have no basis of truth? Not blame you, just your asking to collaborate. You had contacts with many people, dangerous people, I would say. With some of them have keep in touch! With actors, writers, foreign writers and artists... All these persons is ambiguous and susceptible to betrayal... And sometimes it for spies... One of your friends, an Englishman, Mr. Morris... - The Albert; - Just The Albert! Are you aware of the homosexual tendencies? And what significance does this have? It! He works for the English espionage system. Dear Mrs. Roland, people like you is immoral... Carry within your worm prostitution... Lies! Why do not you tell the truth?

I'll fill it up pencil, before well - well think about it. The tanks will start in half an hour. - What's up, Brown; - Nothing, Captain, I'm just a cold. We must do something, otherwise tanks will explode. Please, Captain! Let me try! It is useless! After we did not make the night, is unthinkable to try now. Another thing heroism more stupidity, Sarge! Brown, turned back! Brown! It's almost 7:00. I think we have to put in motion the tanks. Unit 11 on the right and the Unit 12 in central clearance. Currently, Captain Scott will must have eliminated the minefield. Time 7:45 The English directed to our minefield! Earlier we said that another thing heroism more stupidity...

But if aid does not arrive in time will be carnage! - Whither is the north? - Why do you want to go north? To go to battle, to there not? If you are looking where is the battle Simply follow the sound of shots... Do not blame me, but look a little big... ... and the battle for you will could is dangerous! - I'm old! - Maybe you should go back! - You heard what he said, it is dangerous! - Scared, my boy? Perhaps it would be better to stay at home... ... Watching movies, to help women, to do charity... I'm Lt. Schroeberg! The village has been occupied after a aerial bombing of the Americans. We need tanks, send us immediately part armored. - Where to find the tanks, Lieutenant? - You have to find them. Immediately! - What's new? - Not many things, sir. According to recent reports, the situa- situation seems to be very confusing. The Allies continued the attack... ... but is very strong the resistance Germans. Especially in the Mareth Line. But, probably a few hours... - Frank! - Lord! I suppose you do not know anything for John, right? No, nothing, General! We have thousands people there, you know... Of course, I understand, thank you.
