Just hang around and get into fights. Sis I, I sat for JAMB three times now. Or is it my fault that I’m not as smart as you are? So why don’t you just find something else to do? Like, something you love. Most especially, something that will make you some money. Like what? [sighs] I would suggest you… take up wrestling. [laughing] Considering how much you love to fight.

You can do this. -[wistful music playing] -[inaudible] [wistful music swelling] -Ayo, what's the matter? -[friend 1] What's wrong with him? [friends] Ayo, what's up? He's in trouble. ‪[Ayo sighs]‬ [friend] Ayo-Chukwu. -Why are you taking off your gloves? -[friend 2] Ayo-Chukwu, what's up? ‪-[friend 3] Ayo, calm down.‬ ‪-[friend 1] Ayo-Chukwu, what's up?‬ -Ayo-Chukwu! -What happened? Wow. A small fight and you just knocked the guy down. ‪Ayo, wait! Don't leave like that.‬ Ayo. Ayo-Chukwu! [friends cheering] Ayo, calculate! FRESHBOY-LASGIDI INSTAGRAM [Ngozi] How can you stop now? You're the only one who helps me. Mom, you don’t understand. You don't… I can’t go back there. See, I'll find another job. And in the meantime? [Ngozi] You want to become a lay-about like your brother? For my sake. For the sake of your long-suffering mother, stay there. Stay there until you can find another job. My dear, I know that your salary is small but at least it's something. I don’t like the job. You won’t understand. [wistful music playing] -Mr. Philip can help us. -[in Igbo] No, Anu! We are no beggars! You will not rely on any man, no matter who he is! I did that with your father and see where it got me! We will stand on our own two feet. Okay. But I'm tired! Just know I told you that I'm tired. [sighs] [in Igbo] My God. -[sighs] -[male voice] Mama Anu. ‪Yes?‬ [male voice in Pidgin] I want to buy something. [wistful music escalates] [lively music playing] You never know how to handle these things. [Ani] Excuse me. So? So I… Wow. Honestly, I didn’t expect you to be back here so soon. We had a deal. I’m a man of my word. So I brought your money back. I don’t need it. It’s yours. So, what do you want me to do? Well, maybe… you teach me how to play draft. Hmm? [chuckles] Well, honestly, I… I didn’t look that far ahead. There's a possibility… that you would have won that fight. Nah, never! [chuckles] Not with the way you fight. I’ve never seen anybody fight like that. Don't get me wrong, I'm good with my fists. But look what you did with my lips. Well, there’s a whole lot more to boxing than throwing punches. You need to watch some more boxing. [scoffs] [in Pidgin] Not possible. We only watch soccer in this country. [scoffs, chuckles] I know. I know. You know, my father was a boxer. -Really? -Yeah. Okay. So that's why you go around the streets, fighting, beating up people, huh? [chuckles] -Where is he now? -Huh? Your father, where is he now? I don’t know. He’s not around. Well, sorry about that. No. Not that he’s dead, no, he's not. Well, it's just that as far as I'm concerned, ‪he left for America before I was born.‬ So… ‪do you miss him?‬ Ha! How can you miss someone that you don’t know? How? Very senseless stuff. And I've been moving on with my life without him. Very crazy human being. Hmm. Bro, please can you teach me? Please. Can you teach me, bro? [Ani sighs] Can you teach me how to box? I don't think that would be a good idea. Why? A trained boxer is a lethal weapon. And I don’t want to be responsible for you killing someone out there. Bro, no. Please, I won’t. I promise to stop fighting in the streets, if that is. Please. Well, I don’t know. [hisses] Bro, please. Look, I promise I’ll do anything you say. Anything. Look… I came, I even came… I came with my dad’s old boxing gloves. Where did you get these? They were my dad's. My mom kept them and I took them from her room. She's been hiding them under the bed. You shouldn’t have taken them. Why? They may be very important to your mother. [scoffs] My mother hates my father. I'm seriously dead serious. And personally, you know what I think? ‪She even forgot‬ ‪she was hiding these things.‬ [sighs] And what about you? What? You hate your father too? I don’t know. [in Pidgin] I don't care about him. Bro, I don't. I don't know. I don't have any feelings, I don't have anything… All I ever heard was that he was a coward that abandoned his family. It's stupid. Very stupid stuff. See, bro. [in Pidgin] Forget about it! [in English] Leave my father out of this equation, please. Teach me, I want to learn. Excuse me. [tense music playing] [thud] [gentle music playing] [Ayo singing] -[sighs] What is this now? -Ahn-ahn. You’re up early, again? Yeah. I know, I know, Anu. Anu-Chukwu, -[Anu giggles] -What's going on? Ayo-Chukwu, Why are you awake by this time? [in Igbo] Is everything okay? [laughs] Mommy, don't start now. -I am a changed man now. Hmm? -[Ngozi laughs] Where are you going this early, Ayo-Chukwu, changed-man? -I'm going to the gym. -[laughs] Which gym? [chuckles] Samson’s Gym. [dramatic drum beat] -Samson? -[Ayo] Mm-hmm. Which Samson? Samson Da Silva? Yes, mommy. You know him? Ah, that man? Eh, Anu, that man is as hard as nails, really. What are you doing there? [sighs] -Mommy, don't start now. What? -What are you doing at the gym? [Anu] Uh, boxing. What else do they do at the boxing gym? -[roars] -[Anu giggles] Training of the body, -[grunts] mama, [grunts] -[Anu giggles] and the mind. [in sing-song voice] Mommy, yeah, opportunity. -[Anu giggles] -[Ayo laughs] Ngo baby. -[Anu] Come on, get out of here. -Give me this thing, what's your problem. -Take the small one. -[Ayo] Which one is small? -That one is-- -Ha! [smacks lips] Ngo, [in Jamaican accent] I'll see you later. [in Jamaican accent] I'll catch you. [wistful music playing] Are you okay? Did you know he was going to the gym to box? -Yeah, he told me. -Boxing, Anu! Boxing! Of all the things that your brother could do, boxing? ‪[in Igbo] No, no.‬ He has to stop it immediately. As soon as he comes back, I'm going to have that conversation with him. He has to stop. -Why? -I have my reasons. [sighs] The gym owner, Samson, is the same man that misled your father. And now, he's started with my son. [in Igbo] Hell, no! God forbid! I have to go there and stop this. I am going to go there and tell him to leave my son alone. Mommy, if there's anything you want to be telling that Mr. Samson guy, ‪it should be, "thank you."‬ For transforming Ayo-Chukwu's life. -Are you serious? -Yes, of course. Ever since Ayo-Chukwu started boxing, he’s turned a completely new leaf. He doesn't fight again, he hasn't got into trouble, if you haven't noticed. He got off his bad friends. He’s reading and he has registered for JAMB. You can’t do that to him. At least, not now. I know… [sighs] Anu, I just don’t want him to end up like your father. I'm afraid. Mom, there’s nothing to be afraid of. Honestly, I’m on Ayo-Chukwu’s side this time. You need to make up your mind. Do you want your son to do something productive with his life, or do you want him to keep being the king of touts. [sighs] Just calm down. Hmm? Boxing or no boxing, your son is doing good. You have a lot to be thankful for. Okay. [both laugh] [fondly] [in Igbo] My first daughter. All right, help me wash this cloth. Hmm? Sweetheart. [in Igbo] What is, "mm-hmm"? -Mommy, I'm not feeling fine. -[sarcastically] How would you feel fine? -[in Igbo] My darling daughter. Please. -I'm not feeling fine. [expresses exasperation] -[coach] You're hitting me, you hit right. -[Ayo grunts] -[coach] Come on, let's go. -[Samson] Andy… [Samson] What am I looking at? Your new student. Is he drunk? Possibly. [sniggers] Well, I told him no alcohol around the gym when we train. What does he think he’s doing? [laughs] He’s throwing punches like, like an overfed cow. And I’ve seen better stance in pregnant women. Well, he's willing to learn. He wants to do anything. Isn’t that the boy you schooled here the other night? Mm-hmm. Same boy. And he came back? At least he has that going for him, he came back. [laughs] ‪Huh?‬ What’s his name? Ayo-Chukwu. [soft music plays] [silently] Ani. Ayo-Chukwu. Don’t tell me he doesn’t know who you are. No idea yet. Ani! You know what you're doing? It just happened. I didn't plan it that way. Anyway, I’m going to make it work. I'm back to take my family. I'll take my family back. [Ani] Keep moving! Just keep moving. Make yourself a moving target. Come on, three minutes more. Go, go! [Samson] Boy! Hey! Come. [Samson] Come over. Let's do some work here. -One, two.

The local champion, always fighting. At least now, when you beat someone up, it's legal. Oh yeah? Is that what people really think of me? Yes… most people. Well, like my father. So what about you? What do you think of me? What I think doesn't matter. Anyway, you’re slowing me down. I have to go. -Nice talking to you. -Zainab, let me get your number, at least. Catch me and you can have it.

Please have your seat. -[Ani] Thank you. Glad you could make it. So the brokers have looked into your share certificate. And first of all before we start, I'd like to say congratulations. -Thank you. -The certificate is authentic. -Congratulations, sir. -Thank you. Now, in terms of value… when you got your shares, NBL had just floated on the stock exchange -and the shares were worth ten kobo each. -Yes. Which means that your 200,000 shares were worth 20,000 naira at the time of the LPO. Okay. But as of today, in the market, it's 150 naira. A hundred and fifty per share? Yes. Which means your shares are worth 30 million naira [laughs]. Congratulations, sir. [laughing] Congratulations. Now if you want to sell it, I can… I can help you speak to the brokers and… Or maybe you don’t have to sell it. I can just still speak to the brokers ‪and they will help you recover‬ ‪a backlog of dividends‬ dating back to 1992. And that, I promise you will mount up to something substantial. Congratulations again [laughs]. Mr. Animasaun, are you okay? Sir? [laughing] Congratulations! Yes. Yes, I'm okay. [sobbing] I'm all right. [soft music playing] I'm all right. [sobs] ‪[inaudible]‬ -[Ani] Ah, come. Let's do it. -[coach 2] One, two. [Ani] Remember to guard. As soon as you point, guard. -[Ani] Good. Let's go, let's go. -[coach 2] One, two. [Ani] Good, good. -[Ani] Remember your ribs, too. -[yells] Animasaun! [dramatic music playing] [Samson] Hey! Ani! Ani! [Anu] Mom! -[Ani] [fearfully] Ngozi! -[coach 2] Go, go. [in Pidgin] Let's make it happen. What happened? [Ani] Ngozi! Ngozi! Wait, wait. Wait, please. -Huh? -[Ngozi] Wait? [Ngozi] Did you say, "wait"? No, did you just say, "wait"? Ngozi, let me… Please, let me… No, don’t touch me! [Ayo] Mommy, what is this? What's the meaning of all these things you're doing? Ayo-Chukwu. [emotionally] Thank you. Ayo-Chukwu, thank you! Congratulations! So, after everything that I put myself through for you, this is how you repay me, Ayo-Chukwu?! [in Igbo] What did I do to you? [in English] Did I do anything to you? -Ayo-Chukwu? -Mom, what are you talking about? Mom, what is the problem? -You don’t know? -Know what? You didn’t tell him, did you? [tense music playing] Ayo-Chukwu, meet your father. [dramatic music playing] [chuckling in disbelief] You knew who I was all this time? I… [laughs sarcastically] -Ayo, I… -Huh? -What? -I didn't… I didn’t know how to tell you. [Samson] Ani! Hey, stop! Stop, Ani! -What was I thinking? -Get a hold of yourself! What was I thinking about? -[sobbing] -Listen. Ngozi was bound to react like that, it's been 25 years, man! She can do better than me. She can do better than me, so why did I come back? I should have wasted my whole life rotting away in New York. -It's okay. -Why did I come back? You came back because you loved your family. -Which family? What family? -You, you told me you want them. -You told me you want them back! -Did you see, Did you see the way they looked at me? -Hey, it's okay. -[sobbing] -Did you see the way they looked at me? -Easy. Easy, Ani. Like I was some bloody piece of crap. It's okay. It's okay, Ani. -You know. -But isn’t that what I am? -No! You're a good man. -Am I not a piece of crap? -No! You're a good man. Ani! -Am I not a worthless coward? -Ani! You are none of those things! -That's what I am! -[sobbing] -Easy. Easy, Ani. [Samson] Hey. [sobbing harshly] -It's me. It's me, Sam. -[panting] You're a good man. Huh? You're none of those things! You came back because you love your family. So life gave you a sucker punch, so what? You'll come back! -You will come back! You always do. -[sobbing] Easy, bro. Hey. Easy. Easy, bro. -All right? -[pants] [sighs] It's over. Easy. Just take a deep breath, man. -Just take a deep breath. -[inhales deeply] -Yeah. Let it out. -[breathes deeply] -Yeah. Right. -[sobbing] Right. Hey. Easy, bro. Okay. Mommy… [sighs] did he really tell you why he abandoned us? What reason could he possibly have? Twenty-five whole years. Ayo-Chukwu, I don’t want you anywhere near that man. -But what if he trying to-- -[Anu] What if, what? Didn’t you hear what mommy just said? If this man is my father, I-- He's not fit to be called anyone’s father! Did you hear what I just said? [yelling] I said stay away from him! I've heard, mom. Mommy, I've heard. [hesitating] But you've not told me why. The only thing you have said to me about this man is that he abandoned us. But don’t I have the right to ask, man to man, what really happened? Who cares what happened? Listen, that man is a useless, deadbeat father. He left his family to be with another woman! Is that what really happened, mom? Did he leave us for another woman? Mommy, I am a grown man. I need to know exactly what happened. [wistful music playing] [Ani excitedly] Ngozi, Coach Samson came through. I'm finally going to America. He was only supposed to go for nine months. The plan was that he would come back, just after you were born. The first couple of months, he called like, every Sunday. But then, I didn't hear from him for about four months. [Ani] I'm not coming back, just forget about me. I'm not coming back. That was the last time I heard from him. Until today. He left me to suffer with two children for 25 years! And when I finally find some happiness in my life, he shows up with his sorry self. I won't let him ruin it for me! No. Uh-uh. Mommy… Mommy, there must be a reason. That man would not do all these things without a good reason. A good reason? Ayo-Chukwu? -What reason could be good enough?! -That's what I'm trying to explain to her. You're trying to take that man’s side over your family’s? That's not what I'm doing. -So what are you trying to do?! -Anu, calm down! Don't tell me to calm down! Can’t you hear what this ingrate is saying? I think what he’s trying to-- I don’t care what he’s trying to say! -What is the problem? -My problem is you! -Me? How? -Yes, you! You barely knew anything. You weren’t old enough. And you were? [Ayo] Huh? No, talk. Yes, I was. I was old enough to watch us move from one apartment to another. I was old enough to see her cry herself to sleep every night, because she couldn't think of what we would feed on the next day. And I… I had to grow up really quickly, and experience things that young girls shouldn't have experienced only to put food in your belly and a roof over your stupid head! All because of that man. That wretch, that… And you stand there And you stand there to defend him. I am not defending him. So what are you doing? Why am I even surprised? You’re two of a kind. You’re both boxers. And you’re both losers. -[gentle music playing] -[gasps in surprise] [Anu sniffles] Anu! -Clara, Clara! Not my child. -Anu! [indistinct chatter] [friend 1 in Pidgin] Bro, is this you? [friend 2 in Pidgin] Wow, Ayo. Ever since you took up boxing, you abandoned your friends. [in Pidgin] Guys, I'm sorry. I'm dealing with some family issues. -"I am dealing with some family issues." -Can you hear him? [mimicking Ayo's words mockingly] -[in Pidgin] Dude, forget this man. -[in Pidgin] Let's go. -Why are you guys acting this way? -[friend 2] Please, let's go. Ayo-Chukwu! Ayo-Chukwu! Where do you think you’re going? [yelling] Where do you think you’re going? Oh, you want to go and meet him, right? Fine! Go on. Go and meet your daddy. And ignore the family that has cared for you this whole time. But I want you to know something. That man doesn’t care about you! -What’s your problem, Anu? -He doesn’t care about anybody! What’s your problem? Why are you this angry? What's all this vexing for? Look, if there's anyone who should be mad at anything, ‪it should be mom and not you!‬ Yeah, I understand. You see all these things that you're trying to do, I get it. You are jealous. You are very jealous because ever since our father came back to this country, he chose me, and not you. -[Anu grunts] -[Ngozi] Anu! You bastard! Leave me alone, mommy! You bastard! You’re just like your father. A worthless bastard. Get out my sight and go meet your father! [Ngozi crying] Anu! [in Igbo] Ah, my child. ‪[Ngozi] [softly] Ayo-Chukwu.‬ [Ngozi sobbing] Ayo-Chukwu! Do you see, Ayo-Chukwu? [sobs, yells] Ayo-Chukwu! [Ngozi sobbing] [melancholic music playing] Did he tell you where he has been all this time? -I don’t know. -Did he say why it took so long for him to come back? [hesitating] I… No. -Did he tell you exactly what he wanted? -I don’t know! I’m sorry, my love. I didn’t mean to upset you. [crying] I was too shocked to stay and listen to anything Ani had to say. I mean, who leaves his family and returns after all these years, expecting an embrace? What's there to talk about? What's there to explain? I love you, Ngozi. You are the one my heart has chosen… and I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I would give up everything, everything. The cars, the house, even the wealth, just to spend the rest of my life with you. But I need you to bring closure to this chapter of your life. You can’t run away from it. You can be angry now. By all means, be angry. But you have to deal with it. I'll be with you every step of the way. You're the one my heart has chosen. And I promise you, I'm not going anywhere. We'll get though this together. [melancholic music playing] [sighs] Babe, please just calm down. Everything will be okay. How? Did you not hear what that stupid boy said to me? I know. But I've never seen you like this. I didn't even know you felt so strongly about your dad. He's not my dad. That man is not fit to be called anyone's dad. But I still think you need to hear him out. Clara you, you don't understand. You don't know what it feels like. [whispers] Sorry. That man left me when I was a baby. Gosh, the inhumane things that we had to go through. The things that I had to do for us to survive. I'm so sorry. I needed him but he was in the arms of another woman. Who does that? [sobbing] -[melancholic music playing] -[Clara] Sorry. -[Clara whispers] I'm so sorry. -[sniffles] [Clara whispers] It's okay. [Anu sniffles] [lively music playing] -[woman] Okwe. -Hmm? [Okwe in Igbo] All right. -[Okwe in Igbo] Thank you very much. -[grunts] [gate closes, car engine running] [woman in Igbo] What's going on? [Okwe in Igbo] I don't know. What's really going on? [Ani] Papa. Mama. I'm sorry. Please, forgive me. No. Okwe, please. Take it easy. No. -[Okwe spluttering] Let me go. -[Ani] Please. [in Igbo] What is he doing here? [splutters] No, no. Take it easy. He's come to wipe away our tears. [mama] Please. [mama] It's enough. It's all right. [in Igbo] Animal! It's enough. It's all right. [Ayo] Zay! [Ayo panting] Zainab. ‪[Zainab] If my dad sees you around me,‬ ‪he'll kill you.‬ [Ayo] I don't care. [Ayo] Men have died for lesser things. Yes. [Zainab laughs] [Zainab] You know, you're really surprising me. I thought you were just a street bully without reins but not bad. -[Ayo] Really? -Not bad at all. Mm-hmm. I'm not a street thug, Zainab. So… So you don't even know all these things about me. Look, in this neighborhood, everybody knows everybody and as it is, they can't forget your past mistakes. -[Zainab] Really? -Yes, really. And most of the fights I get into, it's because of my mother. See, I cannot allow anybody talk to my mother anyhow. That's why. [Zainab] That's noble but… you're going to have to stop getting into trouble if you want to keep talking to me or seeing me. [Ayo] Okay, ma. Congratulations! Your dad is back. Who told you? So, it's a small area. I'm sure everyone knows about the fight with your sister as well. Oh, okay. Wow. Are you okay? [hisses] Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out what to do. About your dad? No. It's about me. It's about my future, you know. I have this JAMB thing coming up and Anu is still fighting with me. Anu and mommy would think I'm abandoning them. Have you spoken to your mom? No, I haven't. Talk to your mom. Talk to her and then… let everything sort itself out. Everything will be fine. -You think so? -I know so. And then, when you've figured out plans for the future, let me know. Of course. I will let you know because I know you're going to be part of the future. [tense music playing] Guys, guys. [in Pidgin] Not here. Not here, not here. [in Pidgin] Let's go that way. [Ayo] Zainab see, I've been wanting to tell you this thing since. ‪I… [indistinct]‬ [knock on door] Ngo, please. Please. What do you want? I know you don’t want to see me. Well, if you know that, then why did you come? [hesitating] Just give me five minutes, okay? I need to talk to you. If that’s not what you want to hear, then I'll just go away and I won't come back. Please. Please. So, what do you want? Um… I wanted to see you. Well, if that’s all, you’ve seen me. You can go. Okay, Ngo. Please, please. I really wanted to apologize. Oh, it’s too late for that. Oh, let me tell you, going to see my father with that little charade? It doesn't mean anything at all. -Oh, you already know about that? -Yes. By the way, Ani, [sacarstically] we have mobile phones in Nigeria now, and they work! So it’s interesting to think that you did not call all these decades that you were away. You see, you can't imagine how hard it was for me. -And how I tried not to… -How hard it was? It was hard for you to call. Wait, hold on. Let's see how difficult it is to dial a number. Zero… Eight… Zero… [grunts] Three… See how difficult it is to make a bloody phone call. Ngozi, please. Ani, what did you think was going to happen? That you would finally perform my traditional marriage rites and waltz back in here and we would be husband and wife again? Is that how it played out in your head? Twenty five years, Ani. Twenty five years! [tearfully] You left me with a baby and an unborn child with no money. Nothing to feed or do anything else. Ani, do you know how we survived? How we lived? All the things that I had to go through to keep my children, no, our children off the streets. And make sure they had a roof over their heads at night. You have no idea. Through it all, staying faithful to a husband who had vanished into thin air. I didn’t even know if the father of my children was dead or alive. Against all odds, Ani, I chose you. Over wealth, [sobs] over my education, over even my family, I chose you. Why? [sobbing] Because I loved you, Ani, [wistful music playing] with every drop of blood flowing within my veins. I supported you. I believed in you. I loved you, Ani! [sobbing] Ani, I had plans for my life, too. I had dreams, I had hopes and aspirations. But I tossed it all aside to support the man that my heart chose. And what did you do? You pissed all over my dreams and you spat in my face. You made me an object of ridicule. A joke! A reference for parents, warning their daughters never to be as foolish as that stupid Ngozi. I’m sure that my face would be the image right next to the words, "foolish" or "stupid" or "ignorant" in the dictionary. But not anymore, Ani. Not anymore! [breathes deeply] I'm sorry. Ngo, I am deeply sorry. And I want to right all the wrongs. Okay? I know… I know I deeply hurt you and the children. And that’s why we have moved on. I have moved on. I'm getting married, Ani. To a good man. And as far as I'm concerned, you died 25 years ago. I am marrying Philip. And I will not let you ruin my shot at true love again. Your five minutes are up, Ani. Please just… Just go. [inhales shakily] Don’t come back, Ani. Please just go. Ngo, I'm sorry. Don’t, don't touch me, Ani. -I love you. -Just stop… [splutters] Ngo… Ngozi. Please wait. Ngozi! -Mommy! Mommy! -[Ngozi sobbing] -Why are you here? -Please Anu, can you just let me explain. No! You leave! [Ayo] Mommy! Mommy! Oh, I should have known you brought him here. What's wrong with you, Anu, I just got here. Ayo-Chukwu has nothing to do with this. I came here on my own. Fine! Then leave how you came; on your own. Anu. Please, calm down. What? Why are you even here? You’re no longer part of this family! You left us just like, this man. Anu! I am your father. You have no right to call yourself that! -I said I'm sorry. -That's all you have to say, "sorry." So what do you want me to do? Jump off a cliff? Look, I didn't run away with any woman, just like you think. Okay? I was in prison! [dramatic drum beat] In New York, for 24 years. I was in prison! Why did you go to jail for that long? Did you kill somebody? I didn’t kill anybody. The fight promoter in 1993 told me that I was good enough to be a professional boxer. But I couldn't… work as a professional boxer because I didn't have a license. So I needed a green card. After three months in America, he introduced me to a girl, Nancy. [melancholic music playing] It was supposed to be some kind of arrangement. I'll pay her and then she pretends to be my wife. I couldn’t raise the money so he raised the money for me. And I was supposed to pay back from my fights. I swear, it was… [melancholic music continues] It was a simple arrangement. But Nancy wanted more. And I was desperate to get a green card. So I got stuck. So why didn’t you tell me all this over the phone? How would I have told you that? I was frolicking with some white girl in New York, in the name of getting a green card? Ngozi, I love you. I couldn't have told you that! Listen, I thought all this would just go away and I’d put it down as "experience." But… I guess it didn't work out like that. I should have been more careful. I was young, I was stupid. And the next thing, I found myself in court for a rape charge. Rape? So you raped her? Argh! You disgust me even more! I did not rape her, Anu! Listen. Just hear me out. I'm not proud of what I did but… [emphatically] I did not rape her. I did not. I did not rape her. [sirens blaring] [police radio chatter] Rape and aggravated assault. [laughs] That’s what they called it. [melancholic music playing] I was innocent, but it didn’t matter. They wanted me to plead guilty and that the judge would be lenient with me. Plead guilty, for a crime I did not commit? How? The next thing I found myself in prison. Forty-year sentence. Forty years. [sighs] [sniffles] I thought my life was over. The day I was sentenced to prison was the day I called you, Ngozi. I thought my life was over. That was why I called and asked you to forget about me. [sighs] I was done with my boxing career… my life, my family… the love of my life. My… my attorney said… I needed to spend about 25 years in jail before I could be given parole. Twenty five years! [laughs] [sniffles] That's why I called and said, "Just forget about me." I was… [sound] Twenty five years! How could I have asked you to wait for me for 25 years? But in all those long years, I never stopped to think about you. I never stopped to think about you. How you would manage with the children, how hard it must have been for you, and how very angry you would be with me. [melancholic music continues] You know, the day I decided to spend my life with you, I made up my mind to take care of you. To protect you, to fight for you. I didn't plan this to be so. I didn't plan this to be so. Anu, I'm really sorry I was not there for you. And all of you, too. I'm sorry. Please just… find a way in your hearts to forgive me, Anu. Just forgive me. -[melancholic music escalates] -[sobbing] [Ngozi sobbing] Mr. Ani! Mr. Ani! [melancholic music playing] Mr. Ani! ‪[tense music plays]‬ Daddy! Mr. Ani! [in Pidgin] So you're calling your daddy now? You're calling your daddy to come help you, right? [chuckles] No problem. But when a bastard calls for his daddy, who will answer him? [all] Nobody! [Ani in Pidgin] What's going on? Femi, calm down, I'm not interested in fighting anymore. Look, I'm sorry. Please let me go, I'm looking for my dad. What are you talking about? Who's interested in your apologies? After you landed me in the hospital, collected my girl, hurt my brother, you're telling me you're a changed man? It's payback time. Femi, are you even listening? It seems your ears are dead. You never listen. I said I'm a changed man! Let me go. Okay, I'm sorry for anything I've done to you in the past and future. So let the matter die. -[Femi] Are you… -Is he mad? -[Ayo] Femi! -He's telling me he's sorry. ‪You're sorry, right?‬ Tope, you remember how he beat you that day? -[Tope] Of course. -[Femi] All right, beat him back. -I should beat him? -[male voice] You heard the man. ‪I said beat him, then I'll finish him off!‬ [yelps] [fast-paced music playing] [Femi] Are you mad? Are you crazy? [Femi] I will fuck you up! Come back here! [Ayo grunts] [Femi] You're mad! I will fuck you up today. [shouting] [yelling] -Daddy! -You'll die today. -Daddy! -You'll die. I will kill you today. -[Ayo] Daddy! -[Femi] Come back here! -Daddy, they're coming for me! -[Femi] You will die today! -Hey, hey! Hold on. Listen, listen. -Get out of the way, let me kill this guy! -Get out of the way, let me kill this guy! -Hey, hey. Just hold on. Take it easy. ‪Don't tell me to take it easy.‬ ‪This is between me and him.‬ Ayo-Chukwu, come outside! You've been acting like a tough guy, right? Oh, your muscles can't protect you. -[gunshot] -Hey, hey. -Son, put the gun down! -[Femi] You think I'm playing? -Get out of the way, sir. -Put the gun down! Who are these guys, Ayo-Chukwu? Daddy, they're boys from the area. I've told them I don’t want to get into trouble. -Hey son, put the gun down. -[in Pidgin] Get out of the way, sir. [in Pidgin] Okay, I've heard you. Go away, let me kill this guy. Then, you'll have to shoot me first. [expresses surprise] You want to waste your life for this piece of shit? I will do that. That is my son there. -His son? Get out of the way, sir. -Put the gun down! -[yelling] Get out of the way, sir! -Put the gun down! -[yelling] Get out of the way, sir! -[Ani] Hey, hey. -Sir, get out of-- -Hey! [gunshot] [windchime music playing] -Mommy? -Ayo-Chukwu. [sighs] It is well. [groaning] Where am I? [groans] [Ayo] Mommy, what happened? -Ayo. -Mommy, calm down. Zainab, you’re here? Where is my father? I’m here, son. I'm here. You know, you’re much braver and stronger than your father. And that hooligan who did this to you is already in police custody. And I'll make sure he rots in jail, even if it’s the last thing I do. [Ayo sighs] Dad, this is Zainab. She's my… -Yeah. [laughs] -[Zainab laughs] Yeah, I know. Zainab and I already got introduced. And you know what, boy? You’ve got eyes for very good things, like your father. [chuckles] Anu, you're here. -Yes. -[Ayo] Wow. How’re you doing, knucklehead? I’ve been better. Being shot, isn't as much fun as I thought it would be. -Really? -[Ayo laughs] But now I'm a legend. [chuckles] Well, better to be a living legend than a dead one. Anyway, now that I can see that you’re alive, I gotta go to work. -Bye, mom. -Bye, darling. ‪[softly] Ayo-Chukwu.‬ [grunts, groans] [melancholic music playing] [Philip] What room number is he in? [Philip] What room is he in? Philip Ude. I know. Ani. I heard what happened to Ayo-Chukwu. I've been trying to call Ngozi and she’s not picking up her phone. Well, um, Ayo-Chukwu is fine. The bullet hit him in the shoulder but he’s a strong boy. He’ll survive it. -I'll just, I'll just get her for you. -Thank you. [Ngozi laughing] Ngo. Can I see you for a moment? There’s somebody here to see you. [mouths] Me? [aloud] I'm coming. -[Philip] Hey. -Hi. ‪Let's… talk?‬ It’s not his fault. Then whose fault is it? Who left you and your daughter with an unborn child? -He did! -With my consent. Who was it that got mixed up with a loan shark in America? With the mob? Frolicking with different women? -He did! -Philip! He… he was just trying to do right by us. He did what he thought was best for his family. What's best for his family? And the only way he could prove that was to have affairs with several women. After 25 whole years, he now comes back and expects to see you in one spot? Ngo, I have never loved a woman the way I've love you. And I honestly can't begin to think of living the rest of my life without you. Philip, my life has no meaning without my family. You have shown me what it means to be truly loved and nurtured by someone. [tearfully] I mean, everyday, you make me feel like a queen. Your queen. And what I feel for you, Philip, is so real and it's true. [sobs] But I just need time. Philip, he's… [sighs] He's the father of my children. I need time to sort this all out. [sighs] -Ngozi… -Philip, please. If you truly love me, you will do this for me. I… I… I need to sort this out. -[Philip sighs] -But in the meantime, just… just hold on to this for now. Just for now. Please. [wistful music playing] -[in Pidgin] Proud girl. [laughs] -[laughs] How am I a proud girl? You know you've been acting proud towards me. ‪-[laughs]‬ ‪-[Ayo chuckles]‬ -You're welcome, ma. -Thank you. -Hello, ma. -[nervously] Where's your father? He left just now.

Yeah but… I promised to bring you to America. You are here in America. -Yes. [chuckles] -New York City. As they say, "better late than never." Yeah. [laughs] And you know what? I've decided I'm going to give ten percent of the 200,000 shares to Ayo-Chukwu. [soft music swells] And another ten percent to Anu. And -for my wife, -[laughs] because she's the best wife in the world. I'm going to give you thirty percent of the shares. [mouths] Ani. You would do that? For all the years that you waited for me. For all the years that you agonized. You're a good woman, Ngozi. You're a good woman. Well, I may not be Heavyweight Champion of the world but I'm the heavyweight champion of this family. Yes, yes. [laughs] -Yes you are. -Yeah. Imagine Ayo-Chukwu on the streets of New York. -Ah! [laughs] -[laughs] -[laughs] -We have to beg him. [laughs] -You know what I want to do? -What? I'm going to set up a gym. Even if I can't be World Champion, I can train a world champion. Ani, train who? -Ayo-Chukwu is as good as me. -[laughs] Oh my goodness.
