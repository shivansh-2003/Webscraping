[electric guitar intro notes play] [man] In my culture, it is often said that twenty friends can help play together for twenty years. [voices chatter in background] That is true. You and I have, however, defiled that truth. We have been friends for more than 20 years. [gentle music playing] And I know I don't say this often, or celebrate you much for that matter, but you're an amazing friend. A business partner. So as you clock the golden age [laughs] with an additional five years, I wish you joy beyond words, continued success and achievements. By the way, I'm proud of you for being on the Forbes List of 100 Most Influential business men in Africa. That was for those who live under a rock in a mottled hill. [chuckles] Above all, I pray you find happiness that warms your heart and gives you pleasure. [laughs] Can you please stop dyeing your beard? Maybe now you'll finally get older. [laughs] Happy birthday. [mobile phone vibrates] Hey guys. ‎Man of the Hour. [Temi] You mean, Man of the Day? You know you're trending on Twitter, right? -[Temi] Are you serious? -Yup! Your dad is a superstar. [Temi] Why won't you just come on Instagram, dad? ‎You'll be celebrated there too. Cause Instagram is a joke. ‎If you want to have the adult ‎conversations, get on Twitter. -[Temi] Excuse me? -You're excused. So dad, how're you doing? ‪[Temi] ‎Oh no! You're not going‬ ‎to change the topic that easily. [Temi] I take exception to that statement, you know. -Oh my goodness, you're so touchy. -[Temi] I am not! ‪-Guys, guys, please now. Please.‬ ‪-[Temi] ‎Take that back, too!‬ Today is not about Twitter or… Instagram, or about the two of you, either. Today is supposed to be about me, your dad. Right? ‎I'm sorry, dad. But for real though, how're you doing? ‎I see you're in the car. ‎Where are you headed? -Home! -[Temi] Already? Is the party over? -You guys knew about that? -[Temi] Well, yes. [Temi] Uncle Akin told us about it and I told him ‎that I would be out of town ‎for my best friend's wedding. I'm sorry I wasn't there, dad. We're all just thankful that you didn't spoil the surprise with your blubbing. [Temi] Leave me alone. That only happened that one time. [Temi] Anyway, dad. I hope you had fun. ‪Yes, I did. I did. And…‬ How are you, though? How's everything going over there? Fine. Ugh! I'm sorry I need to go now. The reception is still on and they need me. I'll talk to you later, okay? [Temi] Love you! Bye! I need to go too, dad. I'm meeting some friends at the pub. ‎I just thought to call you ‎before you head out. Listen, [stutters] how's work though? And the weather? -Work is fine. -How's it going? The weather is crazy, as usual. And I'll call you back later. [laughs] -I love you, dad. -Love you, too. -Bye. -Love you, too. -[soft rock music playing] -[clicks] [woman softly] Tunji. -[woman] Tunji! -Hmm? -I've been calling you. -What'd you say? [scoffs] You know, all these guys. You can't even imagine how they make their money. And they won't tell anybody. Adebanjo, Danladi… And even this Mr. George. You know this guy, right? He banks with us. Are you serious? I don't know Mr. George, or whatever his name is. I have been trying to have a conversation with you! Okay, chill. Relax. What's up? ‪You were meant to come get me‬ ‪at the salon. What happened?‬ [sighs] [sighs] I fell asleep. [sighs] Okay. Let us assume you were sleeping. When you woke up and saw my missed calls, why didn't you call me back? Kaima, I woke up like two minutes before you got here. You're already here. Why are we arguing about this? Do you want to eat something? ‪Um, I have a bit of pizza‬ ‪left over from earlier.‬ Yeah. I'm kinda hungry. Been at the salon all day. Okay, um… It's in the freezer. Just get it out and microwave it. Please bring some for me as well. Thank you. [tuts] Wait, um… You were saying something. Why did you go to the salon, again? -To make my hair. -Oh, it's new! [laughs] Ah, so nice. [Tunji] You look nice. [lively hip-hop beat playing] [woman] Good evening, sir. What would you like to have for dinner? [George] Uh, Nkem. I won't eat. There was a mini-party in the office today. It's my birthday. Oh! Happy birthday, sir. Thank you. You can retire for the night. I'm fine. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. [lively hip-hop beat continues…] [sighs] [mobile phone vibrating] [chuckles] Ame. Look at you. Birthday boy. You still… dye your beard. ‎It's not going to take away ‎how old you are now, will it, darling? Thank you, Ame. Who're you celebrating with? I hear music in the background. I'm home alone. Where's that old slag of yours? She's not an old woman. Ame, she was five years younger than you. I could have thought different. She certainly looks way older. Sure she's not taking care of herself. So tell me, darling, what happened with her? ‪Well, things didn't work out.‬ Ha! God. You still don't know how to take care of a woman. Do you, now? Thank you. Ame, what do you want? To say, congratulations! You've made the list. The Forbes List. I heard you made the Top Hundred African Businessmen. Hmm. That's a big deal, love. Thank you. -Who did you have to pay for it? -Excuse me! Come on, now, Georgy. You can't tell me to believe that the man I married for years, who could not take care of me, is that rich, he could make the Forbes List. ‎It's the Forbes now, darling. Isn't it? You're rich, but not that rich. Or are you, now? Ame, thanks for calling. -And the kids? -Call them! I do call them but they hardly speak to me. Not the way they talk to you. Oh. And whose fault is that? Certainly yours. If only you had made the Forbes List… years ago. Just maybe things would have been different. Ame. Thanks for calling. Bye. Tsk. [soft piano music playing] Oh boy. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. [sighs] What a day. [knock on door] Kamsi! ‪[knock on door]‬ Kamsi… [chokes] Kamsi! -[clears throat] -[knock on door] Kamsiyochukwu! ‪[persistent knock on door]‬ -[yells] Kamsi! -[uproaching footsteps] -Mommy, what is it? -Someone's at the door! [door opens] [Kamsi] Hi. -Hi, mom. -Hello, Ugo. How are you? -I'm fine. -Your hair is nice. -Yes. So pretty. -Thank you. What? Where are you going to, looking all dapper tonight? ‪Andrew is taking me out.‬ [Ugo] Oh. -Okay. -I think… I think that's him at the door. -[Kamsi] Hey! -[Andrew] Mmh. [door shuts] [Kamsi giggles] -[Andrew] Mmh. -[Kamsi giggles] ‪You look great!‬ -[Kamsi] Thank you! -[Andrew] And you made your hair, too. All for you, baby. -Hey! Kamsi, [in Yoruba] don't kill me. -[mom clears throat] Good evening, ma. -Hmm. I understand. It's cute love. -Sorry. [all laugh] Good evening, Andrew. Okay. Well, I'm ready. And so… you guys have fun, eh? -Thank you, mom. -Have fun. So… are we expecting you back home tonight? Mom? [scoffs] Are you saying she should sleep out tonight? I'll… I'll bring her home. See, if you can't, don't worry. It's okay. At least, we know where she is. Hmm? -[laughs] Thank you, ma. -Okay. Please, bring her back home tonight. -[mom] Son, enjoy yourselves. -[Kamsi] Okay, Mom. -Good night. -[mom laughs] -Bye, Mom, Sis. -[mom in Igbo] Okay. You don't have to come back. -Mom! -Hmm? [scoffs] I don't understand. Are you trying to tell Kamsi to sleep out with a guy? Guy? Is he just any guy? [in Igbo] Are they not dating? They're dating! They're friends. So? Kamsi is still such a little girl. She's not even done with school yet. And then she has to do her Youth Service, get a job… [laughs] And then probably have to think about a guy. Really? So because you went that way, everybody must follow you? Huh? Do you know that if you had been sleeping in Tunji's house, he would have proposed to you? Proposed? [laughs] [sighs] Proposal is the last thing on my mind. Tunji and I have only been dating for what, eight months? [scoffs] I'm too busy trying to get my job secured at the bank. Hmm. So why are you worried? Why are you worried? Tunji is a bank manager. So all you need to do is just secure your place. First of all, Tunji is not a manager. He is a senior account officer. -Hmm. -And secondly, [scoffs] I'm not with him because I'm trying to secure a place. [in Igbo] Oh, please! I didn't say that. Don't put words in my mouth. I'm hungry. Is there still any soup in the house? There is. But you'll have to manage it. Tomorrow is Sunday. And er, the market is not open. Hey, come. [in Igbo] Come here. Come. Alright, take this. [sighs] [lively music playing] What's wrong with you? You're not in this game. What's wrong? ‪Are you sunning‬ ‪from the euphoria of last night?‬ I was until Ame called. So why are you letting that woman… Why'd you keep…? ‪You keep indulging her.‬ ‪What's wrong with you?‬ We were married for ten years, bro. -She's the mother of my kids. -So? So, get another woman. Come on. -After the last two relationships? -Who's talking about relationships? -[chuckles] -Akin. -Akin, you're a [laughing] dirty… old man. -[chuckles] Yeah, thank you. Call me an old man if you like. -You're a shameless man. -Thank you. Well, every man has needs. Every man. D'you get it? We all have needs, yeah, you know what I mean. -[chuckles] -I'm managing my needs very well. [in Yoruba] Yes, keep fooling yourself. That's it. For real. I mean, I'm serious. I mean… she can't just keep doing that. She can't just waltz into your life and mess it up anyhow, anytime she wants. [spluttering] What's wrong with her? -[mobile phone vibrates] -Is that you buzzing, or it's me? Oh my goodness. I think that's you. [sighs] Hello? Manager. How are you? [Ugo] So, what do you think? [laughs] It's not like he's going to notice it. -Really? -[laughs] I was just joking. But that is not fair. I mean, you know that he was distracted. Hence the reason why he didn't notice my hair the other day. But that is why he's trying to make up for it with the date. Um… This. You like this one better? When is he coming to pick you up? Uh… I guess I have to call him to find out. [gentle guitar music playing] -[mobile phone rings] -[TV blaring] Hello? Hey, babe. So when are you coming to get me? Err… About that… [melancholic music playing] Look, I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. I don't understand. What's going on? Well, I have to stop at Mohammed's to pick up a package, and then I have another stop in Ikoyi. ‪That one is for work, anyway,‬ ‪so it's very important.‬ And our date? -Um… -Tunji! Okay, you know what? Why don't you just meet me at The Second Stop? -We can go together from there. -[sighs] But babe, why? This was not the plan. You were meant to come get me from my house. Kema, please stop whining. I told you this was something very important. I'll send you the address. You can take a taxi and meet me there. I'll pay for it. What's going on? -We'll just get a taxi together. -Wait, wait. [laughs] He's not coming to pick you up? Okay. [clears throat] [sighs] -Good day, ma. -Hello. -Yeah. -Can I help you? You're here… Did you make reservations? ‪-Um… no.‬ ‪-Okay.‬ So you're joining someone that made a reservation. -I guess. Tunji. He's my boyfriend. -Tunji. Tun… -Tunji what? -Tunji Adebayo. He asked that I meet him. [soft music playing] I'm sorry, ma'am. There's nobody by that name. -What? -Nobody by that name, Tunji Adebayo. -Oh, okay. Excuse me. -Sure. Hello? Tunji, where are you? You asked that I meet you here and I'm here already. Sorry? No, I can't hear you. Can you say that again? [sighs] I don't even have enough on me. Why would you tell me sit down and stay calm. This place is pricey. I can't afford to buy anything here. Alright. Let me go. [Kema] Hi. So sorry. I think I got the name wrong. -I'm not here to see Tunji. -Well, okay. So who are you here to see? -[waiter murmurs indistinctly] -Thank you. -[waiter] So may I take your order now? -Not yet. I'm still waiting for someone. [waiter] Alright. [mobile phone rings] Hello, Tunji. Tunji, what's the meaning of this? -I've been waiting for over 20 minutes. -[Tunji] I'm coming. What kind of embarrassment is this? ‎You didn't bother ‎to ask what's keeping me. -Do you think I'm playing here? -Well, how am I to know if you're playing? If you didn't want to take me out, you should have just told me ‪instead of keeping me here like this.‬ Kaima, stop complaining. -I said, I'm coming. You'll see me now. -[sighs] Right. Okay. Your wait is over. I'm here. Tell me what you want. ‪-Excuse me.‬ ‪-I'm all yours.‬ -I thought-- -What do you think you're doing? -I'm sorry, I thought. -[laughs] Sir. I'm going to assume for the benefit of the both of us that you're making an error of judgement ‪thinking that I clearly am‬ ‪somebody that I am not.‬ So, in another couple of minutes somebody is going to be seated on that chair, and that person is not you. So I will do both of us a favor. I'll be going to the bathroom. By the time I get back, I don't want to see you on that chair. Okay? [hisses] [soft hip hop music playing] [silently] Wow. I'm sorry, sir. Is there a problem? Well, I thought you said she was waiting for me. She mentioned your name, sir. That's why I had her sitting down here. Well, there must be some mix-up. -Okay, just seat me somewhere else. -Right away, sir. I'm really sorry, sir. -It's fine. -This way, sir. Kema, -Tunji-- -I know, I know. I just have to get this. Well, first of all, congratulations on making Forbes Africa One Hundred Most Influential Africans. Congratulations! -Thank you. [laughs] -[laughs] How does it feel? [sighs] Overwhelming. -Yeah? -Yeah. I mean, it's been… You know how you say you can't feel your face? -I mean, I can't… -[giggles] I can't feel me. It's like I didn't have a life before Forbes. I was gonna say. ‪I mean, you must have people‬ ‪coming at you left, right and center.‬ Absolutely crazy. I mean, it's, my life has just been one rollercoaster. [laughs] Yeah. Good afternoon, sir. Sorry to interrupt. Er, I'm the one my manager told you about. Oh. I'm Tunji from the bank. I'm one of your account officers. -[George] Oh. -This is Kaima, my junior colleague. Oh Kaima, hi. How are you? [mumbles] I'm fine, I'm fine. -So, I have the papers for you. -Okay. -[Tunji] Just sign here. -[George mutters] -[George] Here? -Yes. -Well, I'm trusting you with this. -Oh, that will be okay, sir. -On this check. -Yeah, I can take this, sir. -[George] There you go. -Thank you very much. ‪-I appreciate your time.‬ ‪-[George] Thank you.‬ Congratulations on making the Forbes List. -[laughs] -[laughs] Thank you. I wasn't surprised at all. So well deserved. -Thank you. I appreciate that. -I'll go now. -Alright, okay. Let's go. -Alright. Kaima, have a good one, yeah? Alright, bye. Yes. Where were we? Exactly. Just as we just were talking about it. Look at what happened. -[laughs] -Have you met me? [both laugh] So let's talk about your new project. What are you working on? -Oh so, er, I'm working on fine wine. -Okay. Now, I'm been working on this, on some recipes for a wine company I just bought. [indistinct chatter] So, what is it now? Tunji, I want to tell you something. -What is it? -Promise me you won't get upset. What? Tell me. Are you crazy? How could you let that happen? -But you promised you won't be mad. -I didn't promise anything. Look, you have to find a way to fix this. Do you know what would happen to me? Anyway, you're just a Corper. You don't understand what it's like to have a job you really protect. Imagine if he ran this up to the manager, or even the ED, what could happen to me! But I didn't know! I can't believe this happened. Look, you have to sort this out. You have to… You have to find a way to apologize to him. In fact, I don't even want to go out anymore with you. -I'm taking you home. -Tunji, it's not fair. [melancholic music playing] [Kaima sighs] -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -I'm here to see Mr. George. -Do you have an appointment? -Err, no I don't. -Then, I'm sorry, you can't see him. Please I really need to see him. My job depends on this. [sighs] Look, I don't want to waste your time and mine. There's no way you're getting past me, if you don't have an appointment. -Please, my sister- -I'm not your sister. Okay, sorry. But please I need to see him. It's a matter of life and death. -[Kaima] Excuse me, sir. -Sir! -Good afternoon, sir. -Sir, she doesn't… -Kaima! -Yes, sir. [laughs] I'm so surprised you remember me, sir. Oh, I recognize you alright. Much more than you can ever imagine. Sir, about the other day, I'm really sorry. It was a-- It's not important. You hungry? [gentle music playing] I'm going to lunch. Huh? And if you insist on apologizing to me, the only way I'm going to listen to you is if you come with me to lunch. ‪So are you coming?‬ Thank you. -You're welcome, Mr. George. -How are you, Sam? ‪-Your menu, sir.‬ ‪-No, don't worry about me.‬ -Hi. -I'll take the usual. -And, can I suggest something? -Yes! I think you should go for the prawn brochette. -Okay, that's fine. -Did you hear me? -The prawn brochette for her. -Alright. Thank you, sir. Okay. Wine? Err, speaking of wine, I… I got a little something… just to apologize for how rude I was the other day. I'm really sorry. I know it's small but please accept it. Thank you! Err… The other day, I had no idea who you were. My senior colleague did not explain to me properly and um… it was err… I was just a bit… It's okay. It's okay. [laughs] It's fine. The reporter that um, wanted an interview from me had waited a very long time so… she would have appreciated my coming. [sighs] Thinking about it now, I… I can understand how you must have felt. I'm sorry, still. I was having a very bad day and… I'm sorry. I just hope this doesn't reflect on how you see our bank. Forget about it. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. [mobile phone rings] [mobile phone rings] -I'm sorry, it's work. Can I answer it? -Please. Take it. Thank you. Hello? [laughs] [Tunji] What's wrong with you? Why haven't you been picking up my calls? I have not been taking your calls because I couldn't. [Tunji] What do you mean, you couldn't? [sighs] Tunji, you asked that I apologized for what happened, ‪and that's exactly what I'm doing.‬ And I'm in here having a conversation with you instead of doing that. [Tunji] Okay, okay. Calm down. -[sighs] -[Tunji] I didn't know. So how did it go? -It's ongoing. -[Tunji] Still going, how? When I got to his office, he was heading to lunch and asked that I come with him. [Tunji] Wait, wait. So you're out to lunch with him? [whispers] Yes. Hello? -Tunji! -[Tunji] I'm here. [Tunji] So it's going good, then? Well, yeah. But I have to go now because it's rude that I'm keeping him waiting. [Tunji] Yeah, okay, sure. Call me when you're done. [sighs] [sniffs] [sighs] So… it's your Youth Service year, right? Yes, sir. I'll be done in two weeks. After the two weeks, what next? [sighs] Well, I'd love to get retained at the bank. but [sighs] banks never retain Corps members so… Never say never. [Kaima laughs] Well, they haven't retained a Corper in about 20 years. So I think it's safe to say, "never." So, you wanna be a banker? Yes. It has always been my desire. I have a son who is an investment banker in England. -Oh. -And my daughter who is here, between the events she organizes and the ones she attends, -I don't know which one is her job. -[laughs] ‪[both laugh]‬ -I think she sounds very interesting. -She is. [both laugh] [gentle music playing] [George sighs] Um… -Hope you like your food? -Yes, I do. [sighs] I have to go back to the office. I've… been gone for too long. But you haven't even finished your food. [sighs] Yeah, it's fine. I have to go now. -You're sure? -Thank you. I got it. It's okay. I'll get it. Okay. Okay. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Thank you very much. [chuckles] [laughs] ...you would have time to do. You'll settle in fine. And please, if you have any issues, let me know. I'll be there to guide you. -[Kaima] Thank you. -[Tunji] Corper! -Alright. -[Tunji] Let me talk to you. -Excuse me please. -It's fine, then. Sort it out. Why did you call me like that? "Corper, come here!" We have to keep this relationship down. You know I can't give anybody the idea I'm giving you any special treatment. I'm not asking for special treatment. All I'm saying is, be less condescending. Okay, I've heard you. So, what's up? Well, I apologized and… he accepted. Okay, so… we're good, right? Everyone around the world is happy. Okay, okay, that's great. Okay, so… Go back to work. I have a meeting. I'll talk to you later. Okay. [gentle hip hop music playing] So… Okay, here you go, sir. -Good man. Thank you, thank you. -Thank you, sir. [laughs] [Temi] Good evening, Dad. -Hey! -[Temi] How are you? See who is here! -Dad, I… I do live here. -Oh, really? -You could have fooled me! -It's not that bad! Really? ‪What's this?‬ ‪You're still receiving birthday presents?‬ No. This is not a birthday present. This is… an apology. -An apology? -Mm-hmm? Okay. Well, um… I'm not going to get into this right now because I have to go. -But you only just got back! -Yeah, I know! I just got a message about a meeting and then I have to go meet up with a friend. So… I'll see you later, okay? Mwah! -So I'll uh-- -Uh, before you ask, I am coming back tonight. Be safe! [door opens] What is it? Mommy, guess. Young lady, stop playing games with me. What is it? [in Igbo] What is it? [mom] What is it?! [in Igbo] What is it? Hey, what's going on? ‪[splutters inaudibly]‬ What is it?! I got retained at the bank! [mom yells in joy] [screaming] Hey! -Really? -[Kamsi] Ugo! [singing in Igbo] ♪ I will raise Jesus up high in praise ♪ I just got the news. -Oh, thank God! -Thank you. -[in Igbo] Really? Thank God! -[Kamsi] So happy for you. -Thank Tunji. -Tunji had nothing to do with that. Yeah. When I told him, he was surprised as well. Really? [spluttering] I thought you said they don't retain Corpers in the bank. Yes, yes, they don't. This is a first. -Really? -Aw, I'm so happy for you, sis. -Congrats. -[mom] Hey! -[Kaima] Thank you. -[Kamsi] I'm so happy for you. -But how did you get retained, then? -Well… I don't know. Let's just say I have a guardian angel. [mom laughs] -Really! -Congrats. -[Kaima] Thank you. -Congratulations. -Thank you, mom. Thank you so much. -Congrats, sis. Kaima! [laughs] -Good morning, sir. -Morning! How are you? -I'm fine, thank you. -How's work? -Work is fine, sir. -Good. -I got retained. -Oh. [laughs] See? -Miracles do happen, eh? -Yes, sir. They do. -I told you. -[laughs] Never say never. Huh? -Really, really happy for you. -Thank you, sir. -Good morning, sir. Welcome, sir. -Thank you. Uh, I'll take it from here. You can't handle it. It's fine. I just need something really small and I'll rather she handles it. It's okay. Anything you need, I'll take care of it. Oh, it's alright. What I need is not really a big deal. I want her to do it so we can release you to do the bigger stuff, right? You don't have a problem with that, do you? -No, sir. -Good! Good man. [laughs] Yes. Yeah. So, do you like it? Yes, I love it. -Thank you so much, sir. -For what? -For what you did right now. -Oh, it's nothing. I can't stand guys who lord their little powers over underdogs. You know, I was an underdog once. -You were? -Of course. I haven't always been rich and influential. [laughs] You know, so I know how it feels to be an underdog. You know what I'm saying. [laughs] -How are we? -[George] Hey! Good morning, sir! ‪What a pleasant surprise.‬ ‪You didn't tell us you were coming.‬ Well, I needed to make a little enquiry. Oh, come on. You didn't need to have come. We could have sent someone to you. Well, I needed to stretch these old legs. [both laugh] Interesting. Err… Err, I'll just go right to my office. Thank you, sir. -Yeah. -And thank you for the work you're doing. -[manager chuckles] -Thank you, sir. I must say that… your suggestion that we retain her was a master stroke. -Brilliant. She's doing very well. -Oh? Thank God for that. [both laugh] That worked, huh? Good man. -Can we go to my office? -Sure. -Tea or coffee? -Err, whiskey? If not too early. Of course, I'll oblige you that. -[laughs] -Good man, good man. [Kaima sighs] [indistinct background chatter] Kaima, I've been waiting for you. What took you so long? ‪[Kaima] I'm sorry, sir. I had to get this.‬ [indistinct background chatter] -Excuse me. -Okay. -What was that about? -What was what about? [Tunji] The whole Mr. George thing. What did he want? [Kaima] Nothing. Okay. So I just went upstairs with him to have a conversation. And then, Mr. Adepeju came and took him into his office. -That's all? -That is all. You didn't have to get anything for him or do anything for him? He said that because he didn't like the way you spoke to me. Maybe if you stop speaking to me anyhow in front of people, ‪everyone won't think you're an ass.‬ Fine. But you know the only reason I do that is because I don't want anyone thinking I-- Thinking what? I'm no longer a Corper, so what is your excuse? I'm not making excuses. Just be careful around all these randy old men. You know how they are. So do you want to do lunch or… dinner together? Anyone is fine. I'll call you after work. [Kaima] Excuse me. -How are you? -Why did you do it? What? My guardian angel? The one who got me retained? Oh! Busted. Why did you do it? I don't know. I… A lot of people owe me favors and I like to collect from time to time. Thank you very much, sir. And I don't say that lightly. I really appreciate your help. It's nothing. Here. My card. If you need anything… anything at all… -just call me. -Thank you. [mobile phone ringing] Ame, what?! [Ame] What's wrong with you, George? Did you see my missed calls? Oh, you're avoiding me. Oh, this is about the money I asked you for, is it? -[laughs] -Where's the food? -And why are you laughing? -Oh, sorry. It might take a while but when it does come I assure you, I promise you, you won't regret it. And I'm still laughing though. [laughs] But seriously, what's wrong with you? It's just that, because you like her. [sighs] Look, [laughs] have you been listening to anything I've been saying? Yeah. Temisan might even be older than that girl. [laughs] I agree. But yet, you went to a banking hall to see her. [laughs] No, I went into the banking hall to transact some business. -The manager and I needed to do business. -Is that? -Yes! -[laughs] When was the last time you got into a banking hall? When? You and I know that the bank comes to you. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Yeah, right. [laughs] I went there because I have business to do. And I'm sticking to it. I don't have business… The business was giving her a card so she can call you. [laughs] -What's, oh God! What's wrong…? -I get it. -I get it. -I'm just trying to look out for the girl. You know, help her in any way I can. Yeah, you know, Mr. Generous. You help her, she helps you. Yeah, I get it. [laughs] -Akin. -What? What's wrong with you? Look, I'm done with you. -You are just a shameless man. -Thank you. -How are we friends again? -I know. I'm the only interesting spot you have in your life. -Well, apart from Ame. -No, no. Ame… is not interesting. She's irritating. There's a difference. I don't… So why do you keep indulging her? What can I do? ‪-She's the mother of my children.‬ ‪-The mother of my children.‬ I know. I've heard that line like one million times. I can imagine how colorful her words would be when she finds out you're dating a girl who is almost half your age. [laughs] -Ame. [laughs] -[spluttering] How? -I just can't-- -You're laughing now. How does it help me? No, well, I'm not supposed to help you. I mean, I'm just having fun. I mean, you know, my twins are always happy with me, you know. [laughs] You asked to see me, sir. The loan you approved for Fine Wine Limited has been disbursed. Yes. I got a mail to that effect. Good. Well, I was collating reports and I noticed 20 million naira in figures instead of 200 million naira in their offer letter. I want to take it that that was a mistake on your part? -What are you going to do about it? -Yes. Yes, err… I'll get him to sign another letter. As soon as possible. You have till 9:00 a.m. Tomorrow. And if you don't, I will escalate it. And you know what that means. Right? Sir, you don't need to do that. I'll get it done. Thank you, sir. Yes, hello. [indistinct background chatter] Err, Kaima, can I speak to you please? [sighs] -What's up? What's going on? -I'm in some serious shit. Okay. What happened? Remember the offer letter Mr. George signed at the restaurant on Sunday? Uh-hun. I made a mistake on it. Wow. What are you going to do now? [sighs] We have to get him to sign another [hesitates] offer… I don't even know if he'll give me the light of day. I'm sure he will. You know he's a very nice person. If you explain to him, he'd understand. He didn't even want the loan. ‪He only collected it to expand his‬ ‪business so that I could meet my target.‬ And he gave me his time on a Sunday and everything. Now, this. -Baby, you have to do this for me. -Huh? I don't understand. You need to take the offer letter to him and convince him to sign it. Me? Why me? Why don't you do it yourself? Haven't you been listening to anything I've been saying? ‪Babe, I have. It's just--‬ Look, the guy likes you. He'll be more relaxed if it comes from you. Please. ‪But you're a senior account officer,‬ ‪why can't you…‬ We can just say it was your fault. And that you have to rectify it. Please, baby, please. Do this for me, come on. But you told me to stay away from him. Your words exactly. "Stay away from randy old men." I know, but… It's not like he's going to grab you in his office. Look, just get him to sign it. It's no big deal. If you love me, you'll do this for me. ‪Come on.‬ [deep sigh] [keyboard keys clicking] -Hello. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. Uh, my name is Kaima. I work with Bridge Bank. -I'd like to see Mr. George. -He's not in the office. Please, this is very urgent. I'd really appreciate it if I can see him. I already told you. He's not in the office. Okay, will he be back soon? -[sighs] I don't know his daily schedule. -[man] Here you go. [sighs] You're a life saver. Thank you. [laughs] Please. I have work to do. Can you at least help me? Please? [laughs] It's not like I helped you the first time. And look, you girls know how you do these things. We girls…? [laughs] [sighs] Hello? Of course, sir. I… I was trying to look at what we were doing but… [secretary] Okay. Oh, I'm looking at it right here, sir and… I'm really looking at it right here. [secretary] I have it… I have it right here with me. [secretary] But sir… [secretary] Alright, no problem. Of course. [sighs] [secretary chatters indistinctly] [Kaima sighs] [mobile phone rings] -Hello? -[Tunji] What's up? Are you there yet? Tunji, can I call you back? -[Tunji] Has he signed it? -Please. [sighs] Any luck? No. I guess I have to leave now. -Hmm. -I'll just come in another time. ‪Please do that.‬ Thank you. [secretary hisses] [mutters] Special package girls! [clicks tongue] [sighs] -Hello? -[George] Kaima. -Good afternoon, sir. -How are you? [coughs] -Are you okay, sir? -Err… -Not feeling too well. -Oh. I'm really very sorry that I disturbed you, sir. -It's fine. What's up? -I need a favor, sir. Um, please, just wait here. I'll get him for you. Okay. Thank you. [George sneezes] Ugh! -[Nkem whispers] She's here, sir. -Oh, okay. [coughs] -Good afternoon, sir. -Hi. [sneezes] -I'm so sorry to bother you, sir, I-- -Ugh. It's okay. I'm fine. Stop looking at me like that, it's just a flu. [sighs] I'm not dying. It's okay. -Thank you. -[George sighs] Thank you. [clears throat] [sighs] Actually, my… [coughs] Sir, are you okay? Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital? [coughs, clears throat] My doctor was here earlier on. Gave me some medication. I just… Ugh. It just made me woozy. So sorry. Thank you, sir. Sir. What would you like to eat? I'm fine. I don't want to eat anything. Ah, you haven't had anything to eat. You barely ate your breakfast. It made me nauseous. Sir, my mom's special pepper soup recipe would help. Hmm? [hesitates] I'm sorry. I'm sure you guys have it under control. ‪I'll just be on my way.‬ No, no. Wait. I'll like that. -Huh? -Your mom's special… pepper soup recipe. I'd like that, if you don't mind. I don't mind. I'll just prepare it and bring it here. Tomorrow? -Thank you. -[Nkem] But… Sir, are you sure about this? You don't even know what's in it and we're not even sure in what condition it was made. She'll do it here. Yeah, she'll prepare it here. Under your eagle-eyed supervision. That way, you'll feel better. Yeah? -Yes, sir. -It's fine? -Yeah, it's fine. -Thank you. [softly] Don't mind the girl. -[louder] Thank you. -[Kaima] Thank you. [gentle music playing] [indistinct background chatter] Guess what? [laughs] Did he sign it? Yes! [laughs] Yes, we have it! I thought you said you didn't want anyone knowing we're together. Yeah, don't worry about it. It's okay. You are the best. Okay… After work today, anywhere you want to go, we're there. Hmm. Are you not gonna ask me how I got it done? Does that matter now? What matters is, it's signed and it's in my hands. -[silently] Okay. -Okay. -You're so amazing. So… -You're welcome. ‪It's a date, right?‬ -Um, I really cannot-- -Wait, sorry. [mobile phone rings] Hello? Yes, sir. Um… I'll be right with you. I'm sorry, babe, I have to go. After work, right? See you later. -[telephone rings in distance] -[indistinct background chatter] [mobile phone vibrates] Hmm. -Hello? Kaima. -Good evening, sir. -I'm alive. -Were you able to take a nap, at least. Well, I tried but my head is like a construction site. I'm so sorry, sir. Have you been able to eat anything, at least? Not really. I had, um, had some juice… apple juice and an apple. That was all I could take. Alright, just hang in there a little. I'll be there shortly. Okay? Thank you. I'll try. Thanks. Bye. [gentle music playing] [laughs] [hisses] [sighs] [mobile phone vibrates] Hey, Kaima. [Sammy] Dad? Oh, err, Sammy. -How are you, Sammy? -You okay? -And, who's Kaima? -I'm okay. I'm… -This way. -Um, okay. [Nkem] Yeah, so… [Nkem] So if you want, you just… [Nkem] You don't have to put too much… Just… [Kaima sighs] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to wake you up. It's okay. I wasn't really… sleeping deeply, anyway. -I made the soup. Do you want some? -Yes, please. I'd appreciate that. [gentle music playing] [groans] Oh, Lord! Have mercy. Oh, boy. [grunts] Hey, um… -Thank you. -You're welcome. Let me get water. Thank you. [grunts] [grunts] [sighs] Hey, Dad! I'm so sorry I couldn't come earlier. How're you doing? Hmm? What's this? Mmh! That tastes really good. Nkem really outdid herself. Nkem didn't do this. Oh. Where did you get it from? -[Temi] Oh? Yeah? -Hello. [gentle music continues] Um… Hi. -[Kaima] Hi. -Kaima, hi. Uh… Kaima, this is Temi, my daughter. Temi, this is Kaima. Huh! Hi, Kaima. How are you? -Hi. Nice to meet you. -[Temi] Hi. -Nice to meet you. -Um… Kaima came yesterday to… do some work from the bank for me and… decided to help me with her mother's special recipe when she found out I wasn't feeling too well. That's so sweet of you. -Thank you. -See, my dad here rarely gets sick. But when he does, he's just-- [sneezes, coughs] Bless you. I'm sorry. [laughs] -I'm not terrible. -Sorry. Maybe you should take some more soup. It will soothe your chest and throat. What about me? I mean, is this soup just for sick people? [laughs] -No. Let me just get you some. -Okay. [gentle music continues] You're just shameless. You're actually going to eat something that some other person prepared for your dad when you were gallivanting around town. I mean, it's not my fault. It's not like my mom taught me how to make "special soup." It's not like there's anything special about her anyway. -Tems. -Yes? -Don't speak about your mom like that. -Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Well, let me go and check with Kaima. Make sure she's putting more meat in my soup than yours. Okay? I'll be back. -You're still shameless. -[Temi] Kaima! [sighs] -[upbeat music playing] -[door slams] [Temi] Hey, Dad. I thought you'd be upstairs sleeping already. Hmm? Who're you chatting with? I'm not chatting. I'm just sending a message. How're you feeling? -Well, maybe better. -Yeah? You look better. Well, Kaima's… pepper soup did some magic. [laughs] I bet you Nkem doesn't like that at all. -You know how she can get. -[laughs] You can say that again. [sniggers] So um… How did you guys meet? Well, she works at the bank. She brought some papers for me to sign here at home. And so um… you guys are just friends. Mm-hmm. Nothing more to it. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, you know, I wouldn't have a problem if there was more. You know that. [gentle music playing] [grunts] So… you don't think she's too young? [laughs] [laughing] No! What age…? Look, everybody deserves to love and be loved. And I just want you to be happy. You know I love you, right? -I know, baby. -Okay. I love you, too. Do you think there's still more pepper soup? Go and check. Hey, buddy. [laughs] How're you feeling now? -A lot better. -Okay, Dr. Matthew came over to see you? Yeah, he did. But the drugs he gave me just made me so weak. -But the good thing is… -Yeah? Kaima's pepper soup… [laughs] made me feel better. Kaima? That's the Youth Corper girl you've been crushing on, yeah? [laughs] I told you! She came? [laughing] And she cooked for you? [laughs] -You need help. -How was she? She's not that kind of girl. Spin me another story, bro. Huh? It happened here, didn't it? We didn't do it! [laughs] Okay. So she came to your house, probably dressed in a nightgown and cooked for you, and nothing happened? -A long story. -Ah. We're old men. Time is all we have. So, I'm all ears. Well… -But we didn't do it. -Yeah. [both laugh] See how relaxed and fresh you look? [laughs] -Akin! -Huh? -I'm serious. You need help. -Ah, well. Keep deceiving yourself. [sighs] Honestly, this guy is really annoying me. I mean, he's always looking for one… one excuse or the other just to blow me off. [sighs] What's his excuse this time? Imagine him saying something like his cousin is coming in from the UK and he lives in Ibadan and so himself and a couple of their friends want to surprise him. Really? Is that not the same excuse he gave the last time? The last time, it was his friend. This is his cousin. -A friend is coming in from Dubai. -[sighs] Are you sure this guy is not cheating on you? I don't even wanna think about that. [sighs] I'm pregnant. [laughs] -Is Ebuka aware? -Of course! He's over the moon! He's literally called all his relatives to tell them about it. He's so excited. [laughs] Wow. So I'm gonna be a godmother? What were you saying? -Wait, what do you mean? -[laughs] So who's gonna be her godmother? You better don't try it. [both laugh] ‪[gentle music playing]‬ What's that look? Huh? I know that look. And I also know that you've not given Tunji something like this so… Who's the guy? Do you remember the man I told you about? The one I said I met? That I was rude to the day I was meant to go out with Tunji? -Oh my God! Girl! -What? -Oh. -[laughs] Aw! -[softly] Stop it. [laughs] -I know. I know. Oh. -Oh. [laughs] -[laughs] [upbeat music playing] -Please, um… -Okay. [sighs] [door opens] [Kaima] Hi. Hey. [Kaima laughs] Hey. See who finally came to check on her patient. You know that it was nothing like that, Mr. George. Call me Seye. You didn't really have to do all that. Oh well, I didn't get to where I am today by being ungrateful. You cooked for me when I was not feeling well now, I want to return the compliment. [claps hands] Plus. The last time we… we ate out, you seemed really uncomfortable. [laughs] Er… so, anything that I could help with? Nope, nope. You go out there, sit, make yourself comfortable, and wait for my masterpiece. Okay. [laughs] Okay. -I'll be waiting. -[laughs] [door shuts] Oh. [soft music playing] [indistinct murmur] -You dance very well. -[laughs] [soft music stops] -[laughs] -Hey. [laughs] -Nice choice of music. -[laughs] Considering that it's from your playlist. ‪Oh, yeah.‬ ‪That compliment was for me, actually.‬ [both laugh] -I see. -Yeah. It's better than all the crap you guys listen to these days. Well, it's not that bad. We still have some good music, though. I mean, of course, if you're patient enough to weed through the trash. -[laughs] -Yeah. You have a point. I mean… [singing popular song] ♪ Your body oh, gbo, gbo, gbo ♪ [laughs] -[singing] ♪ Your ass, gbo ♪ [laughs] -[laughing] Where did you learn that? -The kids? -No. Social media. Twitter, to be precise. -Twitter. -Mm-hmm. -You are on Twitter? -Yeah, why? Do I look too old to be on Twitter? [laughs] I just feel like Twitter is for the strong hearted. I never pegged you for the savage type. Well, there are a lot of things you still don't know about me. Yet. -Hmm. -So… How's work? Well, work has been tough. [sighs] I have to meet up with targets and considering my virtues, -I'm not ready to compromise any of them. -Hmm. To just get accounts and of course, get favors. -But those are hazards of the job I guess. -I hear you. -How about you? Recycling, huh? -Mm-hmm. How do you know where and what to do? Well, you find a need and you provide for it. That's the best way to make money. -Really? -You know. -So… [sniffs] -Err, what is burning? Excuse me. [laughs] -Nkem! -[laughs] [upbeat music playing] [Kaima laughs] Yeah, this was really good, Mr. George. I enjoyed it. -Seye. -[laughs] I'm sorry. Bad habit. But it was nice. [laughs] -You liked? -I loved it. Well, I'm glad I was able to salvage it. -Hmm. -Look, I can assure you that -Nkem sabotaged us deliberately. -[laughs] She's afraid we're taking over her territory. ‪[laughing] I can imagine.‬ And this? -Really nice. -Oh. -Really, really good. -Oh. You like? -Mm-hmm. -Well, people have their recipes. Your mom has her pepper soup, and I have my wine. -You made this? -Yeah, more or less. [laughs] I thought you were into recycling. Well, yes. And winery, and a little little businesses, you know, here and there. Actually, now, this started as a hobby. And when your bank decided to give me the loan, -I decided to, you know, upscale a little. -Hmm. And that's how my new business was birthed. "Fine Wine." -Better with age. [laughs] -[laughs] Exactly! -Yeah. -Oh my God. Now, I'm so embarrassed. -Why? -Goodness. Why? The wine I brought to your office when I came to apologize. It was bad, right? [spluttering] Well… -It was, oh no! -[laughs] Wait, wait, hey. -It's the thought that counts. -But it was bad. -Yes. -Mmh. [hesitates] -That was what? [laughs] -[laughs] Yeah, it was… But like I said, -it came from a good place. -Okay. Hey, alright? So, um… Here's to fine wine. -To Fine Wine. -Yes. [soft music playing] -Oh, and another toast, please. -Okay. -If I may. -Okay. -To… us. -To us? -Us. -Okay. -To Kaima, and Seye. -And George. -No. No George. [laughs] -[gasps] [laughs] -Kaima and Seye. -Great. So, what do you think? [Kaima laughs] I can't believe you attended to those flowers all by yourself. I mean, they're so beautiful and serene and… [laughs] What? Thank you. Thank me for what? [sighs] For keeping a lonely old man like me company. [laughs] Thank you, too. I had such a great time today. I can't remember the last time I was pampered like this. Why? Beautiful woman… you deserve to be pampered, you know, like nobody else. [laughs] You should be pampered. [Temi] Dad? -Dad! -Over here, baby! Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't realize you had company. It's alright. -Hi. Hi, Kaima. -[Kaima] Hi. Thank you so much, Kaima, for the pepper soup. -You're welcome. -My dad here has been telling everybody who would listen, about how it raised him from the dead. -[laughs] -Tems, please. -So, do you have any more with you? -No. I actually cooked for her today. I made dinner. -You? You cooked? -Mm-hmm. Wow. Um, I can't remember the last time that you made something. Well, Tems, um, did you have something to do or… -Yes. I'm sorry. -do you wanna stand there and take jabs-- I just wanted to find out if you're gonna come to the club with me tomorrow. [clicks tongue] No. Dad, please, you have to come. It's a really big night for one of my clients. Kaima, you too, come along. [sighs] Trust me, you're going to have a good time. Yeah? -Come on. -Okay. Yes? Okay. Great! So, we're going to the club tomorrow. Um, did you leave any of that food that you burnt for me? [Kaima laughs] I'll take that as you burnt it. Bye, Kaima. Bye. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. You sure? So, do you really wanna go? Huh! She is definitely a friend you wanna do "stuff" with. [upbeat music playing] -I haven't felt like this for a while. -[Akin laughs] I know. -[Temi] Hello! -[Akin] Oh my goodness! [Temi] Hi, Uncle Akin. How are you? -[Temi] Hi, Dad. -Hey, babe. [friend] Uncle Akin, how are you? [Akin] Good afternoon. How are you? -I'm fine. -I've heard so much about you. [Kaima] I'm fine. [Akin] Hey… Um, -take Kaima to get drinks. Yeah? -Okay. Come on. -[Akin] Oh, I see-- -No. [Aking laughs] [Temi] What do you want? [Temi] Champagne? Cocktails? -Eyes on me! Eyes on me! -No! -[Akin] You're gonna have a hard time… -[Temi] Just a cocktail? -[Temi] Hi. We will have, just a red wine. -[Akin murmurs indistinctly] [bartender] Okay. [Kaima] I'll do a piña colada, please. ‪[bartender] Piña colada,‬ ‪red wine, coming up.‬ -[Kaima] Thank you. -Thank you. -So how's work? -[Kaima] Fine! And your work? -[Temi] Sorry. Seun! Hi! How are you? -Good, you? Kaima, this is one of my really good friends, Seun. He's in the "art "business. -[Kaima] Oh, nice. Nice to meet you. -[Temi laughs] [Seun] You're welcome, Kaima. -D'you know what? Let's take pictures. -Thank you. -Let's take pictures, yeah? -Oh yeah. Um, my battery is really low. Can I use yours? -Okay. -Shall we stand in the middle with… Girl! [Akin] I'm having a hard time competing with him. [George] Tell me something I already know. You could [Akin] give yourself very high pressure or hypertension just… Ah, that is so nice. -[Seun] Hey, we just… -[Temi] Yes. Let's take some more. -[George] Hey. How are you? -[Kaima] Hey! -You guys are good here? -Yeah, we're fine. -[George] You're, you're okay? -[Temi] So, we'll talk, right? ‪-[Kaima] Yeah, I'm fine.‬ ‪-[Temi] Okay, I'll send you the pictures.‬ But I thought you guys were just getting drinks? No, we just wanted to give you some time with your friend. ‪We don't need any time.‬ I thought you guys were coming back after like 30 minutes. Which, what do you want? Err, -I'll get you something. -[bartender] Wine for my lady. Oh, thank you. -I just want you to be-- -[thud] [all shriek] -Hey! Are you blind? -[bartender splutters] I'm sorry. -I'm so sorry, sir-- -How does being sorry… solve this? -[Kaima] Hey, it's okay. -[bartender] Let me clean that up! -[Kaima] Hey, it's okay. -[Temi] Come, let me dab ir here for you. [Temi sighs in annoyance] Gosh. It's ruined it. I don't think it's going to come off. -[George sighs] -[Temi sighs] So sorry. Can you… do you have a change of-- -[bartender] So sorry. I'm, I'm-- -Hey, hey! -Just get off! -[bartender] I'm so sorry, sir. -[Temi] Sorry. -[Kaima] No, it's okay. [Kaima sighs] What, how're you gonna do this? You know, I don't have any change of clothes so I guess I'll just go home… No, do you know what? There's a mall really close by. ‪We could go pick up something.‬ Please, do that. Alright? ‪-No, I--‬ ‪-Hey, hey!‬ -Just… -Come on. Hand bag. Pack your bag, let's go. -[sighs] Really? -Come on! Tems, spoil her, okay? [Kaima] Oh my God, are you being serious?

[Temi] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know but… I think… -that this… -[Kaima sighs] What do you think? Just go and try it. Hmm? Just try everything and then we'll see what works best. [gasps] Let's see. Oh! Kaima! Did I give you my phone? [Kaima] No. [sighs] I can't find it. I think I left it on the table. [Kaima] Okay, do you want to use my phone to just dial it? -Yes, please. -[Kaima] Alright. ‪Thank you.‬ [sighs] Oh, gosh. It's switched off! Let me call my dad and see if he has it. [Kaima] Okay. [laughs] Seriously. Hey, Dad, do you have my phone? Ugh! Thank God. Maybe it was the network. Okay, so, we're almost done, and then we'll see you guys soon. Okay? Alright. Let's change this. [Kaima] Did you say something? [Temi] I was wondering why you had my dad's name saved so formal. [Kaima] Okay, well… We met under very formal circumstances. -I guess. -[Temi] Fair enough. [gasps] [Temi] Oh, I guess it's time to change that. [Temi] After all, he is crazy about you. [Kaima laughs] Much better. Hmm. Okay. [grunts] Let me see. Nope. Okay. I think you're coming home with me. Kaima, are you done? [Kaima] Err, I have tried two already. But you could always try on more. Okay, let me see. -Ah… ooh! -[Kaima sighs] Really? [Temi] This is perfect! And this. Alright, so just try this on and then let's see. Okay? -[Kaima] Wow. Another outfit. -[Temi laughs] [sighs] Kaima, you have to get this bag. I mean, this… Oh, geez. [gasps in ecstasy] Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. -Just… -You like it? -This is perfect. This is-- -You like? ‪It's almost perfect.‬ Hold on. Wow. [Kaima laughs] -[gasps] -Turn around, let me put it on. Okay. This is going to be the look. [Temi mutters] Kaima, this dress looks -amazing. You look wonderful. -It does? -Okay, next-- -I love it! -[laughs] -I think you need this! Let's see. [Kaima gasps] -[Kaima] Wow, that is too much! -You need that, and this! -Lippie. -[laughs] [Kaima] Hi! ‪[gentle music plays]‬ [Akin] You look really nice. Thank you. Um, this was all Temi's hands. [gentle music continues] She made me get a lot of things that I didn't need. Thank you. [George] No, thank you. [mobile phone beeps] [Akin] Um… [Akin] I, um… Um… Here, your phone. [Akin laughs] Now, I get that. Okay, I'm off. -So you said-- -Temisan said-- -You-- -I think-- Okay. [laughs] -Alright, you go first. -No, you go first. I insist you go first. [laughs] You go first. [chuckles] Okay. I like you. Alright? I really do like you. But I'm 55. And you're like, what, 22, 23, or… at most 25? I turn 25 next Saturday. See, the thing is… You make me feel things that I never thought were possible. [hesitating] I really don't know-- I like you, too. You do? I, I don't-- [mobile phone vibrates] I don't… I'm sorry. I have to take this. It's fine. If I don't take it now, she would never stop calling. -She? -Oh, she, yeah, yeah, my ex-wife. -Oh. -The only reason I'm in touch with her is because of my children, you know, Temi… It's alright. Hello? What?! Ame! What? I'm busy. Yes, I'm busy. and when I'm done, I'll call you back. [sighs] -So, where were we? -Where were we? [mobile phone vibrates] -I'm so sorry. -It's fine. Um, Temi… Tems. It's okay, we're fine. Just stay with Uncle Akin. Yes. Alright. [both laugh] You're laughing at me, right? It's okay. Hey, sis. -Hi! -Was that Tunji? Did he get a new car? [laughs] No. -Then, who was it? -A friend. Wow. This dress is nice! -Fine girl, give them! -Thank you. [laughs] -You like? -[Kamsi laughs] I love! When did you get it? I haven't seen it before. Hmm! I got it today. Your friend took you shopping? Hmm. Not really. -Hmm! Hmm! -It's a long story. -Hmm! -What? ‪Wait, so…‬ Your guy friend who's just a friend, not really took you shopping. What else did you not really do? Well, we just talked, and talked. [both laugh] You like this guy. -Come on, give me the gist, sis. -[sighs] Go on, sit. [laughs] Wait. Gist me. -Yeah. I like him. I-- -Clearly. I didn't realize how much I liked him until today. -But the thing is-- -You're with Tunji. Yes. But he's a nice guy. I mean, he cares about me. He's interested in me. Treats me like a lady. [sighs] I don't know if I remember the last time Tunji took me out on a date, opened the door for me, you know. But you know you've been with Tunji for a while. So, overfamiliarity tends to set in. Yeah, I guess. But... sometimes I feel like Tunji doesn't even know that I'm present. So, do you want to leave Tunji for this guy? I mean, you have to make a choice. You can't string both guys along. -That's not fair. -He's… -What? -Nothing. -So who… What's this new guy's name? -[sighs] His name is Mr.… Seye. Well, Seye or Tunji? Who's it going to be? [sighs] He's really caring. I know he's interested in me. I just wish Tunji could have some of the qualities he has, you know. Maybe just a little bit. Or just be like Andrew. Andrew is perfect. Nobody is perfect, sis. Not even Andrew. Trust me. At least, he could try. -[sighs] -Aw, you look nice. -This necklace is new. You went shopping. -Yes, it is! -I'm going to collect… [laughs] -Do you like it? -It's lovely. You look so cute. -Thank you so much, sis. [tender piano music playing] [indistinct background chatter] -[Tunji] Hi, Beautiful! -Hey. What's up? What d'you mean? I haven't seen you since morning, have I? I've missed you. I came to see you. Hmm? Come. Are you okay? Are you sure you didn't hit your head somewhere? ‪[laughs] Of course, I'm okay.‬ Who's that? Um… Is that Mr. George? -It's-- -Why is he calling you? Why's his name "Seye" on your phone? It's a long story. I'm listening. [Tunji] So you're telling me his daughter changed his name on your phone. ‪She must have.‬ I told you already what happened. Yeah. That you went out with him. His daughter invited me. -You could have said no. -That would have been rude. And besides, you left me and went to Ibadan with your guys. ‪I was bored.‬ Your idea of fun is, spending time with an old man. He's not that old. He's just 55. Really? --You're even defending him to me now. -[sighs] I am not. Tunji, I'm just… [sighs] Can I get back to work? I don't want my supervisor to see me here. [soulful sax music playing] You're sure nothing happened? Like what? We just hung out with a couple of celebrities. There was some drinking, eating, chilling… Nothing serious. Yeah, nothing serious, until he tries to get into your pants. [gasps] Look… [laughs] These old men, they use money to lure young girls like you. You really need to be careful. [sighs] Okay. I will. Can I go now? So she's still cutting your calls. -Maybe she's busy. -[scoffs] Can we-- can we just go? You know, the site is really far away and, we still need to see Baniyo to sort out the legal documents. You've been talking about this site. ‪Are you sure it's the best place‬ ‪to put this thing?‬ Um… You saw the feasibility reports now, didn't you? -Yes, I did. -Good! It's a factory. It's supposed to be. -[laughs] -No, it's not. It's too far. -You know, um-- -Are you thinking marketing when we start? When the train starts running. See, I've been thinking marketing. Yeah? Look, Boss. Stop complaining. You got good value for your money. And the factory will bring civilization to that place. [dramatic music playing] -Ame. -Why do you say that all the time? -Say what? -Say my name like that. It's all so formal. You can say, "Hello, darling," or "Hello, darling or dear." Well, because you're not my darling. -Neither are you my dear. -[Akin laughs] "Hello, Ame," would have been nice. Rather than, "Ame." I was once the love of your life, my love. Ame. What do you want? You promised to call back but you never did. -I was busy. -Doing what? When did you become too busy to return my calls. Ame. Can we, please, not do this? Please, huh? -I was on my way out with Akin when-- -[gasps loudly] -Oh. Akin's there? -Yes he is… Please, say hello to him. Ame. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. And yourself? Well, good. Thank you. And the twins? Um, the twins are doing really good, you know. ‪I'm just hoping‬ ‪they'll make me a grandpa soon.‬ -[laughs] -Lovely talking to you. Nice talking to you. Talk to you later, okay? [chuckles] Chat later, okay. [both laugh hysterically] -You're such a Frodo. -Such a lovely, lovely… -[sighs] Can we just go? -Yeah. -So Kaima has finally met her? -No. Her timing is so awful. That's how, when I was with Kaima, she just kept calling me. Calling me, like… [laughs] -If they finally met now, Kaima's my turn? -No darling, no mix. Why? Because, well, if she's going to start dating you, she might as well… She actually needs to know all the garbage with you all the… -I don't carry about baggage. -All that baggage. -Let's go. -[chuckles] Okay. Just sign. -Alright, thank you. So, I'll call you. -Alright. -Are you okay? -So… he's commenting on your photos now. I don't understand. I'm confused. What's going on? -What are you talking-- -Mr. George. -He commented on my-- -Or is it, "Seye"? Wow. He commented on my post? Are you people sliding into each other's DMs now? [scoffs] [laughing] Really? -You think this is funny? -No, I don't. I mean, [sighs] I didn't think he was on Instagram, I thought it was just Twitter. For real? So, it's like that now? He's actually commenting on your photos. [sighs] Look, Tunji, I have no control over what comments he makes on my post. -And- -Maybe his daughter gave him my contact. And now, he's calling you? [Tunji sighs] -Why is he calling you? -I don't know. [sighs] As flattering as it sounds, you sound jealous. [laughs] Jealous? Me, jealous? Come on! I mean, the guy's old. He's not any kind of competition to me. It's you I'm worried about. [sighs] [sighs] I'm not going to take that. Well, maybe you actually should, before he decides to pull his account from us. Hello? [George] Wow. I should go give my testimony in church. I'm so sorry, I've been very busy, sir. It's fine. I understand. -I don't want to be a nuisance, either. -[laughs] Oh, goodness. -You're not. -Good to know. Anyway, I'm calling because of an account you might want to take up. -Oh, really? -Yes. A friend of mine wants to open accounts for his grandkids. I will text you his number and his address and you can hit him up. Oh, thank you so much, sir. I really appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Alright. Bye. I'll send it to you now. Okay, I'll be expecting it. Bye. Wow. Mm-hmm? What's he calling about? He has a friend who wants to open accounts for his grandkids. ‪That's why he called.‬ Huh? How much? I don't know. I haven't got the contact yet. ‪[sighs]‬ Look, it seems to me like the guy also wants something else from you. [sighs] You need to be careful. -Okay? -I will. [laughs] Wow. This is so nice. [friend] The only issue I'm having is this early morning sickness. And now that Ebuka just got a promotion, he leaves home early, -and comes back really late. -I'm so sorry. So how are you coping? Do I have a choice? I just have to cope. Although I would just like to raise my legs up and chill, while I'm being taken care of. [laughs] You're not serious. Get outta here. Hey, I saw the pictures you posted on IG. It seems like girl is now chilling with celebs! [in Pidgin] How did that happen? Where did you meet them? Well, it was an event I attended. Mr. George's daughter invited me. Uh-hun. Wait, wait. The same Mr. George that helped you with your job? -Same Mr. George. -Are you people now cool like that? That is daughter is inviting you for events? Uh. Uh… You know what? Give me a second, I'll call you right back, okay? Okay. No worries. Bye. -Ma? -Hello? Hi, Mr. George. Oh, come on, now. Please. Call me Seye. -Alright? -I'm so sorry. I can't call you by your name. I was raised better than that. But… I could meet you somewhere in the middle. Hmm… -SY? -Yeah, that's fine. I can live with that. -Okay. SY. -[laughs] [laughs] I'm sorry I couldn't take your calls earlier on. ‪I've been in‬ ‪one meeting or the other all day.‬ It's okay. I understand. So, how did your meeting with my friend go? Oh, that went very well. Thank you. I really appreciate everything you have done for me. Oh, it's alright. It's not a problem. And about the big one, your birthday… You still haven't told me what you want for your birthday. ‪It's in a few days, right?‬ You remember my birthday? I remember everything about you. [chuckles] So tell me, what do you want for the big two five? Or what do they call it? Two point five? What do you want, tell me? Yeah, I was thinking, do you have any plans for Saturday? [football game playing in background] Well, I can't think of anything right now. Did you have something in mind? Um, I was… Nothing. Nothing, really. Yeah. I can't think of anything but um… You know, it's Saturday. Anything can just come up. The boys can just call and say let's move at the drop of a hat, so… -You never know. -Really? [upbeat music playing] [Kaima] Oh. Okay. Um… -Is this what I'm thinking? -What are you thinking? Uh-uh. Uh-uh. -[sighs] -No phones today. Alright? All phones off. And I'm going to put mine on airplane mode as well, so… -Really? [laughs] -Yeah. You like? I love! ‪[upbeat music continues]‬ ‪[inaudible]‬ So… [tender music playing] Did you have a good time? Yeah. I had a great time. -Thank you. -Me, too. [laughing] Thank you. So… So? ‪You still haven't told me‬ ‪what you want for your birthday.‬ [gasps] After everything you did today? Nothing happened today. We just hung out. In fact, that was a gift to me. Oh. [laughing] Really? Okay. How about the bottle of wine? The same bottles that I said I wouldn't give to you so you wouldn't get drunk? [laughs] Listen, think about it. And when you make up your mind, let me know. -Okay? -Okay. I will. So, um… -Have a good night. -Have a good night. -[laughs] Good night. -Good night. -Good night. -Good night. [Kaima] …there was something-- [crowd shouts] Surprise! [excited voices chattering] [crowd] Happy birthday! [crowd cheers and claps] Happy birthday, babe. You said you had nothing planned. [sighs] Oh no! What are you doing? [crowd cheers] Kaima, would you marry me? [crowd] Yes! Yes! Yes! ‪[crowd cheers and claps]‬ [tense music plays] ‪[crowd chants] Yes! Yes!‬ I'll marry you. [crowd explodes in joy] Yes! [knock on door] Um, I'm in here. [woman] Oh, Kaima. Congratulations on your engagement. [sighs] Thank you. [haunting music playing] [indistinct background chatter] [tense music playing] What's the matter? What is the matter with you? ‪-Why are you dragging me like that?‬ ‪-Can you explain…?‬ ‪Can you explain this?‬ [gasps] I thought you said there was nothing going on. That was your birthday, wasn't it?! You were with him! How much did he pay you to sleep with him? -I did not-- -Don't you…! You're a liar! You're a liar, you… You're so cheap! You're a cheat. You're a slut! Ugh! [pants] [whimpers] Look… The whole thing is a mess! I don't know who took the picture. My phone has been ringing non-stop. I said, I don't know who took the picture. ‪I've been calling her‬ ‪but she's not picking my calls.‬ Dad, Sammy wants to talk to you. Uh… Um… Akin, look, let's, let's um… I'm upset, she's upset, everybody's… The whole thing is a mess. Okay, let's talk later. Sammy's on the phone. Alright? [sighs] Angela, I don't know. [soft music playing] I have to go back to my desk. Been away for so long. I'll call you back. Thank you. [sniffles] [sniffles] [sighing] Oh gosh. My son. That is why I said you should see me. So that, we can settle this. -Mommy. -Hmm? -It's only because I respect you. -I know, I know. -That's the only reason I came here. -I know. ‪-If not…‬ ‪-I know.‬ [in Igbo] Please. Just forgive us. [sighs] -[splutters] -Please. -Mom, what Kaima did was disrespectful. -Yes! -And very painful! -Exactly! Huh? But you know, I asked her… I asked her if there was something between them and she said there was nothing. -[Tunji] Hmm! -And I believe her. [scoffs] I'm not sure I believe it. Mmh. Hey! Just… -Look, I'm 32 years old. -Mm-hmm. And I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing. ‪Exactly!‬ [Tunji splutters] On more than one occasion, I asked Kaima -if she has anything to do with this guy, -Mm-mm. -and she said there was nothing. -You see? But there was nothing. [gasps] Have you just heard? Imagine my girlfriend, no, my fiancée! -[hesitating] Exactly! -My fiancée. -Exactly. -To hear that she's on a boat, -no, a yacht, -Yacht? with the biggest account of my career. How am I supposed to compete with that?! -You see? -How am I supposed to compete with my girlfriend being enticed by some… -[spluttering] dad… -What do you want? You asked me if I slept with him, I said no. -[mom] Just forgive her. -If I were being enticed then, what am I doing here? But, shouldn't you be begging him? -[in Igbo] Hey, young lady. Do you…? -Mommy, you can see. -[spluttering] I see! -You can see what she's saying! -Yes! -[laughs] Do you know you should be begging him? Beg him! [mom clicks tongue] [tearfully] I'm sorry. [chuckles] This union, nothing can scatter it! Amen. God will give you plenty money. Amen! Before people start using their money to bully us. Amen! Amen! [mobile phone ringing] Amen. [in Igbo] Come, my girl. Young lady. [Kaima] Hello? [Ame] Is this Kaima? Yes, please. Kaima speaking. Who am I speaking with? I don't have this number on my phone. [Ame] This is George's wife. And mother to his two grown children. For real? You know, when Temisan said you needed an intervention, I thought she was exaggerating. -Wait, you're trying to get me drunk? -Not really. What…? What are you doing in the office on the weekend? Why? Well, I wanted to do some work on the factory papers. [laughs] [mobile phone vibrates] But one needs to get you drunk to pull you out of your schoolboy… Look, don't, just ignore that. Ignore it! Hmm! Ame. -Hello, darling. How are you? -I'm fine. You don't look fine to me. Don't tell me you're still bothered by that whole social media brouhaha. It'll blow over. You'll be fine. They'll be fine, too. Thank you. We certainly do need to work on your choice of women. I really do wonder what you saw in that girl. ‎She was absolutely way too young for you and, to be honest, unimpressive. After I spoke with her, I just believed that she's just a gold-digging, [scoffs] God, I can't even-- [George] Wait, wait. What do you mean, after speaking to her today? It meant exactly what I said. I had to call her. I said to her to take her gold-digging fangs out of you. [spluttering] I can't… Wait, you did what? You spoke to her? How dare you?! Who do you think you are that you can talk to her? But I'm your wife… love. Ex-wife. Ame. You left me 15 years ago. And just because I indulge you, you think you can overstep? George. I'm still talking. Now, if there's any gold digging person here, it's you! Hmm! Ame, you left me for some richer guy who can't even clean my shoes today. Now, you're harboring thoughts of coming back, it will never happen. You know, it's amazing how you can give me such beautiful children, two beautiful children, but you, you are so ugly inside! And it's because of those two beautiful kids that I give you an allowance from time to time every now and again. And if you think because of that, you can harbor thoughts of coming back to me, it will never, ever happen. Okay? Ame, listen. If you ever, ever talk to Kaima again or interfere in any of my business, I will cut you off completely. -Do you understand what I'm saying? -Yes. I said, do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. If you want anything, you talk to my secretary. But George… I said, don't ever call me again. [Akin cheers] We just went from mourning to celebrating! [laughs] Yikes! That was it. Oh my goodness. [laughs] That was terminal. [laughing] I'm not too sure… I've never done that before. -[Angela] Thank you. -[Kaima] Thank you. -[Angela] Hmm. I'm digging in. -[Ebuka] Baby, sorry. [Ebuka] Suit yourself. So you like it? It's fine. It's lacking a little something though. -[Tunji] Really? -[Kaima] Yeah. Since when did you become an expert wine taster? -I'm not. But it's just-- -It's just what? Oh, because you and err, Mr. George have been tasting some… expensive wines. Or should I call him, "Seye"? You now think you're somebody important. [sighs] So, I have thought about this a million times through. And yes, I crossed the line with Mr. George. [sighs] You didn't deserve that, Tunji. And I am sorry that I did that to you. But Seye did not only teach me to taste wine. He showed me what a real gentleman is like. -Kaima? -He cares for me. He listens to me. He pays attention to me. He doesn't talk down on me. [laughs] I'm sure he doesn't just do this because he likes me but… he does that because that is who he is. Caring, loving, patient, good looking man, in spite of his age. [laughs] [Kaima] Heck… [laughs] You know, he's 55. But he beats you hands down with looks and swag. Oops! [laughs] I don't really care what the world thinks right now. But I would rather be with Seye and I would choose him a thousand times over again. Oops. [clears throat] If he would have me. But just so we are clear, even if Seye and I never work, I deserve better than you, Tunji. -[Angela] Oops. -I do. [sighs] Waiter! Please get me your best bottle of Astis Formante. -We won't be here for long, -[waiter] Okay. and the party needs to start. [Angela] Mm-hmm. -[Angela] Party needs to start. -[Kaima laughs] Um… I'd have told you to go to hell but I was raised better. [sniffles] This… [Kaima sighs] is over. -[Kaima sighs] -[Angela laughs] [laughs] -Wow. So you dumped him in public? -Yes. I was tired of his nagging, and speaking to me always in a condescending manner. Wow, Mommy is going to be so angry. -She's going to have a fit. -Mom will be fine. Hmm? [Kamsi sighs] You know... [sighs] You know, I actually thought that he had turned around, after the surprise dinner. [laughs] What are you talking about? I planned the entire surprise party. Tunji forgot about your birthday. I reminded him. The… The proposal… Oh, that was impromptu. It was like a last minute decision and he only did it because he thought it'd make you stay away from Mr. George. Wow. [laughs] Wow. Good riddance to bad rubbish. [sighs] But um… I'm proud of you, sis. I mean, I wish I had, I had ended things with Andrew long ago. But I was just thinking, Mommy likes him, he showers me with gifts… Everyone thought we were perfect together, you know what I mean. But… It is what it is, I guess. You know, everyone thought that Seye threw his money at me. And well, yeah. He used his connection and position to further my career but he cared about me. Hmm. He respected me. [sighs] He genuinely cared about me. He always made me feel like like I was important, like I meant so much to him. Hmm. He made me feel like I was the world. My point is, when someone cares about you, they would anything to make you happy. [sniffles] Call him. Yeah. I can't. You clearly like him, just… -call him, -What am I going to say? That you want him back. That you like him? He won't take me back. I lied about Tunji. I didn't tell him anything about Tunji. I didn't even pay attention to him, I barely even noticed him. [sobs] He can't take me back, it's too late. [sobs] Besides, he's coming back with his ex-wife. I lost him. [sobs] I just hope he's happy. Sorry, sis. You'll be okay. You'll be okay. Sorry. You'll be fine. [Temi] Dad. Dad, have you seen this? -Temi, Temi, please. -Dad! ‪If it's social media,‬ -I've seen enough to last me a lifetime. -Look, it's serious. -[laughing] Oh my God. -It was really nice, though. It was nice. I feel so bloated, honestly. Stop. But what did you eat to make you feel bloated? That small food? -Hmm. Really? -Babe. Honestly. [in Pidgin] Can't say how I'm feeling but that's how it is. For real. -[Angela] Where is this driver? -[Kaima] Ha! [Kaima] I don't understand why this driver is taking so long. -See, these drivers won't make heaven. -Never. They can't. [Angela] I don't know who that is. [Kaima] Oh my God. [sighs] [melancholic music playing] -Good evening, sir. -Good evening. Are you guys going to say something? I saw your video. The one where you trashed your boyfriend. Sorry, ex-boyfriend. -[sighs] -How? It was me. I mean, I know I told you to, you know, rough it up with Tunji and um… grow old with him together but I know how frustrated you've been with him. I heard what you said at the restaurant about how you feel for him. So I decided to do something. He had told me that you're close to his daughter so I sent her the video via her DM. Ugh! For goodness' sakes! Are you both just going to stand there? Say something. Anything! [hesitating] Your wife tried… I'm sorry. She should never have called you. I promise she will never call you again. And I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Tunji. [softly] It's okay. Ask me again, what I want for my birthday. [laughs] Okay. What do you want for your birthday? You. [gasps] [tender music escalates] [sobs] [upbeat music playing] ‪Translated by HIVENTY‬
