- This is my nightmare! - Pine Falls has always had a dark underbelly. - Everyone there is an outsider. The jocks run the show. - Horton's an asshole. - The smartest thing my parents ever did was take me out of that school. - These kids gotta learn to fight back. No one's gonna do that for them. - Violence begets violence. - I'm tired of folks blaming the teachers. - People always ignore the problem. - She is blowing it out of proportion, okay? Politically correct or not, that's the truth. - Fucking school board outsourcing to a third-party. Yeah, I should have joined the union when I had a chance. But who knew that they would hire a custodial service? Let me tell you something. We're both gonna be out of a job. - No, just you, man. We don't all have rich in-laws to fall back on, Roy. But you know what? I ain't worried about it. Between you and me, Roy boy, I got an ace up my sleeve. Something real nice. The fuck was that? Come on, stupid. Come on. - Way to go, slick. - Whoa! You laughing at me? - You shouldn't have to worry about getting killed in the halls. And I've seen kids get slapped right across the face. And teachers, they just turn the other cheek. And why? Well, I'll tell you why. It's because there's this class system at Pine Falls. And they won't let you know that, but there is. People like me or Alex, we don't fit into their hierarchy. And as a result, no one looks out for us. - What are you watching? Our local SJW. - The kid couldn't hack it. It's nothing to cry about. - Tell that to the Twitter-verse. She's making our school to be some sort of hell hole. - Isn't it, though? Hey! Don't start something you can't finish. - Prince Charles over here. Does that make you my Kate? - Wrong prince, doofus. My mother loves Diana. I know my shit. - Who the fuck's Diana? - Pop quiz. Where is the Eiffel Tower? - London. - You have a great future in wrestling. There is someone in here. - Let's give 'em a show. - Yeah, we so had you! - You had nothing! And you're getting nothing by the way. - Come on. That was a good one. Who is this supposed to be again? - Father Time. - Who? - The old dude. Passes a new year after the baby. - Yeah. Never heard of him. - What time you got? - Uh, quarter till nine. - Shit! It's that late? I got places to be. You have fun, you crazy kids. Jesus! Man, you scared the shit out of me! - What the fuck are you doing here? - No need to get testy. It was just a prank. That's all. - A prank? Hey, Roy! Roy! Where the fuck are you? - I'm sure we can work this out. - Shawn, stop. I said, "Stop!" No! Please! - ... We're on our third hour here on 106.7, The Pine. More surprises ahead as our New Year's Eve countdown-- This was a mistake. I shouldn't have come tonight. - Don't be ridiculous. Jean loves you. - Even after what I wrote? Come on. We can't sit here all night. I am so glad you guys could come! Come on in. - Thank you. - Let's ring in the New Year. - Thank you for having us. - Of course! - Hey, guys! We're gonna head out. - Oh, you're leaving. - We are. But happy New Year. Thanks for having us. - Good to see you. - I miss you, buddy. But I'll see you next year. - Good to see you, man. - It's always so good to see you. - Happy New Year. - Always a pleasure, Rachel. Thank you. - I'm so mad you're leaving. - Goodnight! - Are you leaving? - I know. I'm sorry. - Okay. - Gotta get home. - I'll see you. - Hey, Tony! Try the eggnog, man. It's great. Listen. So, I'm sorry to run, man. But I got grandkids at home I gotta tuck in. They've probably torn half my place apart by now. So, I gotta get back. - It was good to see you. - You have happy New Year, okay? - All right. You, too. - Nice to meet you finally. - Oh, my gosh. - Thank you. - You're the best. Thanks for coming! - Thank you. - Bye! - Is everybody gonna be this well-behaved? - Oh, my gosh. It's fine. Let's go. - Well, look what the cat dragged in! - Did we kill the party? - I don't know. More booze for us. - You guys remember Jacqui. - Oh, yeah. How's the, uh, newspaper business? - Scandalous. - Can we discuss the asking price? - Now? - Gene, if the house is going on the market and I'm going to be the realtor, I have work to do. You should lay off of those. - Hey! How about the boss gets you a goddamn libation? - Sure. - Comin' up. - So, uh, Cliff, how's the team looking this year? Oh, thank you, sir. - You're welcome. - Yeah. Uh, the team. Well, we've never had a good wrestling team. But that Ryan kid's tough. So... - So long as he keeps his hands off my daughter. - Your daughter I would make captain with her feisty ass. - We taught her well. - Uh, we or you? I can't take credit. But I will. - Excuse us, gentlemen. Girl chat. - Maybe you'll find a stunning expos√© on the porch. - Oh, come on! It was a joke. It was a fucking joke! - I am so glad you could come. - A decision I'm already starting to regret. Oh, come on. Faculty parties are rife with passive-aggressiveness. So, this year was your turn? - Yeah. I offered to host. Might as well get it out of the way. Now, if Gene only knew his grief was sitting right next to him inside. - Am I missing something? Oh, yes. Okay. - So, Gene is the only man in school oblivious... oblivious to the fact that Coach Horton is bundling his wife six nights a week. Shh, shh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Are you serious? Shh. Yes, yes. Bless her heart. - I managed to dodge that bullet. - Aw. I wish I could say the same. But we all make mistakes. - Hmm, yeah. - But... Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! Congratulations! - Thank you! Thank you so much! - Oh, wow. - Yeah. I don't know how Tony afforded it. - I-- No. Me either. Wow. Well... maybe now, you can get him to wise up. Who spends years getting their masters only to slum it in public education system? - Yeah. Well... he thinks he's making a difference. - Hmm. We all do. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. I am so sorry. I totally forgot. - No. It's fine. It's fine. - Are you okay? - Yeah. It's just the weather. It's okay. - Yeah, right. - Let's go face the hordes, shall we? - Oh, I don't want to. - Oh, come on. You're a big girl. Let's go. - I just don't see the point in it. Like for instance, last year, I resolved to make more money. - That obviously didn't happen. - And I wanted her to quit smoking. - Another thing that's not gonna happen. But we could all resolve to be a bit nicer. - Ugh! Mother Teresa over here. - Am I, Cliff? Am I really? - You sure seem to be. Oh, I read your article by the way. - Oh. And took none of it to heart. - What can I say? You interviewed a girl hopping a bandwagon? Makes her feel good to point out everything wrong with the school. - I gave her a voice. - Aren't you a saint? - I just don't think this is the place to discuss-- - Look. Take you and me for example, right? I gave you a hell in high school, but... but you're still. And you're better off for it. - You have to take yourself out of the equation, Cliff, if that's possible. There's social media now. A platform that didn't exist when we were kids. - Okay. So, what you're saying is, if this happened today, Tony would have jumped off a bridge, right? - I'm saying you have to be sympathetic. - We always listen. - And yet look what happened. Which is very sad. But you don't take into account what's going on at home with his parents. I mean, to lay the blame completely at our feet? That's not fair. - I interviewed his parents. - As did I. - Then you know where they lay the blame. - What I know is that they're grieving. If I lost Heidi, I'd wanna blame someone, too. It doesn't make it right. - I'm obviously fighting a losing battle here. Rachel? - I don't know what to say. - I think what it boils down to is that we all care. It's just hard to figure out the source of this sort of thing. Excuse me. - What? What?! - I'm not mad at you. I just shouldn't have come tonight. - We shouldn't have brought it up. - Well, you can thank your buddy for that. He's not my buddy. - Do you like it? - I love it. What's wrong? - Nothing. I... I gotta go. I told Heidi I'd pick her up at Shawn's house. - Okay. - Okay. - Who was that? - Mystery guest? - What does that mean? - It means somebody's fuckin' with us. Not really in "fuck with me" kind of mood, though. - Ugh! - It's kids. New Year's Eve. I did the same shit. - You broke into someone's house a hid a cigarette in their cherries? - Hey, bub. How do I know that wasn't you? You guys were in here for, what, five, ten minutes? - I'm allergic to cherries. - Bullshit. - Yeah. I don't... I don't get it. - It's a game. Like a... a scavenger hunt. You go... you go there. Whatever. Find shit. - So, we're supposed to go to the Marlboro factory. - I think I know what it means. - What are we looking for? - Come here. What do you think? - What do I think? I think that somebody just defiled our co-worker's yard. And I wanna know find out who the little bastards are. - All right. All right. Well... let's go have a look-see. - You okay? - Yeah. I think I had enough for one night. - Yeah. You want me to ease us out of here? - Yeah. Would you make up an excuse? - Mm-hmm. - You guys staying behind? - Yeah. I think we're gonna head out. It's been real. - Poker night next Thursday. - I'll be there. Okay. Where are my keys? - Now, read. - "My name is Shawn Ryan. I'll soon be dead." If you wanna save me... you have until midnight to follow the clues and find me. - You involve the police, and I'll be dead. - Ticktock. Ticktock. - Jacqui, are you ready to go? - This is turning out to be one hell of a party, isn't it? - Yeah. - Hey. Thanks for having my back there. - Yeah, man. That's what friends are for. Besides, Jacqui was no angel in school. Don't give me that woke bullshit. - Not much further now, though. - How do you know? You guys go ahead without me. I just need to catch my breath. - What the hell is that? We should go back. - Don't be ridiculous. I'm not scared of a high school kid. - Cliff! - Shawn? - Cliff! He was with my daughter! - Shut up. - Where is Heidi?! - Shut up! We're not alone. Where are you? - Right here. - I can't see you. - Can you hear me? - Hey. Do you mind telling me what's going on here? Who is that? - Rachel. - What do you want? - Where is my child? - Everything you'll need to find the girl is laid out for you in blood. Now, dispose off your phones. - Cliff. - Let me think. - Cliff! - Just let me think first. - Just get rid of your phone! - Dammit! It's our only way of calling for help. If I throw my phone in that goddamn hole, that's it! - If it were your daughter, this wouldn't even be a question. - That was a mistake. - Fine. Now, we just gotta find them. But where? - I know where. Fuck. - Karma's a funny thing. Good people die all the time, while bad thrive. It seems pretty pointless to me. But they say I'm a kid. What do I know? Well, I know one thing. If we speak up, eventually, they'll have to listen. I mean, at the very least, though. Is she... dead? - Yeah. Who would do this? No! No! - What are you doing, Jacqui? We gotta call the cops. - They have Gene's daughter. We need to find him and Cliff and if they're all right... we'll figure out what to do then. - This is insane. - "Bibliothek" means library. If we keep going up in this direction-- - I can't believe this. Rachel is dead. This... this is not going to end well. - What choice do we have? - Whoever's doing this can't be watching them and us at the same time. They're bluffing. - Is that a chance you're willing to take? - Yes. - Not me. I can't. - It's 10:57. Time marching on as our revelers revel outside. Let's go to the phone, shall we? Kevin, you're on the air. - Hey, yeah, thanks. Happy New Year. Uh, with this town the way it is right now, I don't see how anyone, including you, could be celebrating. - How do you mean? - Well, let's see. Um, we got kids killing themselves, parents protesting, a school board totally clueless. Not to mention, the-- - Oops! Hit the wrong button there. Sorry you're having such a rough night, caller. But this is the opposite of a no-fun zone. Pour yourself a Mai Tai and chillax. The world hasn't ended yet. - It's 11 o'clock at night, hon. Obviously, the place is not open. Think about what you're doing, Jacqui. If we go in there, we're playing right into his hands. Hey. Look, I'm sorry about today. I tried my best. - Another day in paradise. - Heidi's a bitch. We know that. Have your tried talking to Mr. Gottlieb yet? He's useless. They all are. - Well, what comes around, goes around. - I wish I could believe that. Why don't you come over tonight? We could hang out. Do you believe in justice? Not some kind of cosmic something, but real justice. - Not really. - What's up?! Ooh, what's up, baby? How are you doin'? - Are you from Tennessee? You're the only ten I see. - Come on, fellas. Didn't we have to kick you out of the bar? - Hey, gentlemen. You're done. Out. - That's assault. - Excuse me, sir. - Happy New Year! - Move it. Move it. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Hey, Powell. What time you got? - I don't know. It's a little too late to be checking out books. - Yeah. - All right, listen. Don't linger. It's cold as hell out. Go home. - Get inside. You'll catch death. Look, it's locked. - Difficult? - Someone's in here. Okay. I want you to stay right here. Don't move. - Mr. Gottlieb, what the hell is going on? - That's a long story. I don't think we're in here alone. - Yeah, I know. There's policemen. - What? There are cops around when I need them? Where are they? - They're around here somewhere. - We gotta find them. - Brendan's dead. What the hell is going on? - It's some sort of a lunatic, playing a game, like leaving clues... - Clues? - Yeah, like some sort of a hunt. Hey! What are you doing? - The day Alex killed himself, he was returning this book. You spoke with him the day he died. What did he say? - You okay? Listen, I know how you feel. You may think I don't, but I do. I just wish someone had told me what I'm about to tell you. High school is not the end-all, be-all. And see, these people who torment you, years from now, they'll be fry cooks. Fellas like us, we always get the last laugh. And you wanna know why? It's because we're smarter than them. - But what about-- - Has anyone threatened you? - No. - Has there been a physical altercation? - Not really. - Then trust me, things will get better. Look, I'm just a guidance counselor. I couldn't change the way the school operated even if I wanted to. Now, come on. We gotta find Jacqui. - Don't move. - Who's that? Police. Put your hands up. - Hmm? What are you doing out here? - We need your help. Please. We're not doing anything. - Who's "we"? Who's "we"? - Just me and Jacqui. - You listen to me. You're gonna listen to me, and you're gonna comply. You understand? - Tom, you have a daughter. Fae. Parent-teacher conference, last October. I was there. - Tony? What are you doing down here? - That is an extremely long story. - You okay? - Yeah. - You don't look so good. - Just a little out of shape. - It's Kathy's place, right? - She was raised here. Uh, her parents winter in Florida. How did you know? - Stand back. Watch my six. - I don't get it. - I do. I can't wrestle. - Bullshit. "Can't" is what your mind is telling you. Get up. - Fuck. Fuck! - Listen, you're not gonna understand this now, but I'm trying to help you, man. All right? You lack confidence, no killer instinct. Don't worry. We're gonna fix it. Again. Again! - Come on, man. Again! - Stop wasting my time, man! Again! Get mad, do something! Again! Oh, boy. Some guys never learn. You will, though. You're mine, Gilbert. Every day, every class, until you get it in your head that there is one rule in life, and that is to destroy your enemy. Now, get the fuck off my mat. - It's that kid. Alex. This whole thing's about him. Just stay here. I thought I told you to stay outside. - It's fucking cold out there. - Not long now, the New Year approaches. Which one of you will be here when the ball drops? - Where are you? - What you should be asking yourselves is who am I with? Only one of you is going to walk away from this. But who will it be? The husband or the boyfriend? - Cliff? Cliff! What is he talking about? - Hello, Coach. This match isn't over yet. We still have one more round. - Kat! - He's trying to... ...turn us against one another. - What are you talking about? - Look. There's both of us here. Let's just get in there and rush this motherfucker. - Why would he say that? - Would you please for Christ's sakes-- - Are you fucking my wife? - Look... this is not the time for this, okay? Let's not do this now, all right? - Think, Gene. You know the truth. - The hell you doing? Would you think about your daughter for Christ's sakes? Fuck. Are you out of your fucking mind? - Aren't we all? - How do I know you're not behind all this? - Because I'm standing here. - I had you over my house. I thought you were my friend. - Fuck! Look, we all are friends, okay? We are. We're all gonna be dead at once if we don't get together on this, okay? Please! Fuck! Fuck! Ah, fuck! - Why don't you come out of there, okay? Why don't you come out of there, and... and we'll take care of this together, just you and me, all right? I'm the one you want, right? Enough. Enough! There. Can we please deal with this? Please? I think you may have to go alone. - Why? - 'Cause I can't feel my arm. - Time's up. Where's your medicine? Right jacket pocket. - Cliff. St... - The library's closed. - This is going to be difficult to explain, but I'll give it a shot. - I'm all ears. - Tony! Check her. - Oh, God. Call for help. Tell them there's an officer down. - What are you gonna do-- - Call for help, Tony! - Hello. Hello! Goddammit! - Hey, Jacqui. All the world's a stage. It's okay. It's me. It's me. Hey. Are you all right? - What are you doing here? - That's a hell of a good question. - All right, listen. We can catch up when we're away from this fucking place. Are there any objections now to calling the police? I think I know where to go. - Well, that's that. - Well, this has to be it. It's what he said. - You can try this. - What now? - But our love, it was stronger by far than the love of those who are older than we. Of many far wiser than we. And neither the angels in heaven above, nor the demons down under the sea could ever dissever my soul from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee. - Okay. Thoughts? Comments? Yes. - I mean, I thought it was cool. - Explain. - Well, it was sad, but not stupid. - Yes. - I didn't get it. - What didn't you get? - So, there's a girl and you're depressed. I understood that part. But the way you were talking and rhyming, was that a poem? - It's called Annabel Lee. - I don't know who that is. - You've never heard of Edgar Allan Poe? - I don't like him. - Why not? - Didn't he kill himself? It's no wonder if he wrote shit like that. She prefers the monosyllabic. I've never had mono. - Hey, let's keep this civil. Let's focus on pros and cons, please. - Suck-ass. - Skank. - Loser. - Syphilitic hose-beast. - Enough! Alex, I thought it was great. It was creative and unusual. It's what I've come to expect from you. - This was our last class together. But I came to see you, and then he... - Who would do this? Why? - Someone obviously blames us. Why else would they go through all the trouble? - Well, Elisha didn't do anything. Neither did I. Neither did you for that matter. - Well, maybe we're not the targets. - I sure feel like a target. - Trying to rationalize the motives of a madman is about as pointless as trying to make sense of some kid's death. - Alex wasn't just some kid. - You know what I mean. Stay here. I'll be right back. - What are you doing here? - I thought you went home. - I thought you were dead. - Where's Gene. - He didn't make it. - There's someone in here with us. - Yeah, who is us? - It's me, Jacqui, and Elisha. - The winder? - All right, devil's advocate. Who do we absolutely know is not the killer? - Tony, you, and me, right? - It's gonna be hard convincing Cliff of that. - I don't care what he thinks. - What about the Gilberts? - They moved away. And do you really see Jim or Patty murdering anyone? - Not really. - Yeah. - What's the one thing we're leaving out of this equation? - You tell me. - Alex himself. - No. Can't be. I saw him in his coffin. - Right. Well, something doesn't fit. - I think he had a girlfriend. - Who? - I don't know. He wouldn't tell me. He said it was a secret. - There's no one there. - Give me your hand. Cliff? Where's Tony? - Son-of-a-bitch clocked him. Where did he go. - Not wise. Especially if you wanna see Elisha again. - What did you do to her?! - Shoot the motherfucker! - Kill me, and you'll never know. - Think about what you're doing here, please. Okay? This is your crazy friend's way of punishing us or whatever the fuck she thinks we did to Alex. And personally, I don't intend to die tonight. Jesus Christ, give me the gun I'll-- - Stay back. - Hey, look. For all I know, you're one of them. - If I were working with them, you'd be dead by now. - Yeah. Well, I'm not the one threatening to shoot an innocent man. - Just let me think! - Think about this. I could have bashed your brains in three times by now, but I didn't. For all I know, you snapped after you wrote that article, all right? You orchestrated this whole thing. And Tony's in on it with you. Maybe you all ganged up on me. Huh? I'm the asshole, right? I'm the bad guy, right? The bully? I mean, if that's what we're doing here, then just fucking shoot me and finish it! - This is entertaining. Perhaps I should-- I'm sick of playing games. Can we call the cops now? - Elisha. - Tony! Oh, my God. Tony. Oh, my God, baby. Oh, my God. Give me one reason why I shouldn't strangle your ass. - You're the one who wanted to shoot me. - That's because I thought you were in on it. How do I know you're not? - Destroy your enemy, right? Thank God. You gotta get me out of here. - Surprised? - I saw you die. - What you saw was a woman with no pulse. I like you, Jacqui. You stood up for what was right. You never ignored the problem or contributed to it. Cliff will be here soon. Just in time for a New Year's slash. This is gonna be a great article for your paper. A survivor's first-hand account of the New Year's Eve of destruction. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll leave the titles to you. What about an exclusive? A round table with the four survivors. You, me, Elisha-- - Elisha? She was in on this? - No. Actually, I didn't expect for her to be there, but good thing Tony's a lousy shot. You killed my fianc√©. Why? - Sorry, Jacqui. - Which should we choose? And don't pretend the prospect of axing Cliff is not tempting. - You said four survivors? What about Heidi? - Would she have gotten away with half the shit that she pulled if her daddy wasn't the principal? - You have no idea how disappointed I am. Same here. - I should have known. You were too good. And goodness gets you nowhere in this world. - Is this your place? - Yeah, it sure is. Come on. - We need to call the police. - We can't do that here. No landline. But if you hold down the fort, I'll go get 'em. - Miss Harper? - Rachel. - Be careful. - Oh. Alex, um, I am flattered, but I'm your teacher and you're my student. - But I thought you loved me. - I never said that. This is just a fantasy you've created. It's... it's because I'm a loser, right? - No! No, you're not a loser at all, Alex. But I-- - I thought you were different. I'm sorry. Just leave me alone. - Alex-- - Please, just leave me alone. "To Mom and Dad, "I'm sorry I couldn't be a better son. "The kind that you wanted. "I'm just sick of being sad. "Being weak. "Being lost. "Coach Horton said to destroy my enemy. "Well... I think that's what I'm doing." - I never meant for you to find out like this. I wanted to ease you into it. But now, you know. I do not blame you for being scared. That said, we have an opportunity to get the world's attention. They'd never listen to you alone. Words are empty. Actions count. And when the dust settles, everyone will pay attention to us. They tried to suppress the truth. I was there! I saw it. - Do you think the school's at fault? - I wouldn't blame them entirely for it, but they probably could have done more. - I mean, absolutely. My... my son goes there. It's a show! - Yeah. I've heard a lot of things about Pine Falls, but, uh, not many of them are good. - We've just experienced a tragedy unlike anything we've ever dealt with before. We gotta suture this wound. I can't tell you guys what to do. But as a staff, as a faculty... as a family... I strongly suggest you keep this to yourselves. Yeah, whatever. It's fine by me. Tony's the one who's gotta keep his woman in check. - That's easier said than done. - Rachel? - Whatever you think is best. You of all people should understand what tonight represents. We are fighting back on behalf of the marginalized. - I never wanted this. - Sometimes, you gotta do what you gotta do. When was the last time anyone listen to a victim? Killers become famous. And with that fame, the world lends an ear. - What do you want from me? - Your companionship. I need a partner. A real partner. Cliff would have killed you. Not me. I wanna save you. But I also need your trust. And to trust you, your hands have to be as bloody as mine. You little fucking shit. - Don't ask me about motives. Rachel, she has her little trip. Me, I don't give a fuck about Alex. It's you I want. - What do you want me to do? - Cliff will be here soon. Just be yourself. - Et three, Judas? - I know what you're thinking. You're thinking you're right. The girl with the big mouth. The one who couldn't just shut up and take it somehow orchestrated all of this. - Well, now, that did cross my mind. - My mistake with thinking that I could change people's minds. An asshole will never admit they're wrong. But, hey, I'm young. You can't fault me from being naive. - Yeah. Where is this going? - I couldn't have done this, Cliff. Or do you prefer Coach Horton? Uh, at this point, I don't give a fuck what you call me as long as you-- - This is it. End of the road. What are you waiting for? Guys like him are why things like this happen. He's always gonna think he's better than us. Remember what you said? "Assholes never admit they're wrong." - I can admit it. In fact, I know it. - Sure. Now that your ass is on the line, he's gonna say what you wanna hear. You give him half a chance, he'll go right back to they way that he was. - You can't solve violence with violence. You tell him that. I never killed anyone that didn't deserve it. - No. You just made them kill themselves. - Tell that to Jacqui. - Wrong choice. - But right idea. Are you all right? - Where... Where are the keys... to the car? You're gonna have to drive 'cause my leg is fucked. - You sure you can trust me? Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty sure now. Listen, you know I wasn't lying, right? - About what? - This just in. Two bodies have been found at the library. Foul play is suspected. Just another day in the Falls, and yet it serves as a reminder that life goes on, until it doesn't. In the meantime, take a listen to this. - Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Happy New Year!
