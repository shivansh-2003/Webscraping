-[tense music playing] -[indistinct chatters, car approaching] [reporter] And yes we are here live at the courthouse. Now, after months and weeks of making major headlines across all media platforms of the country, -the trial has officially started today -[other reporters indistinct chatters] between The State and Chief Musibau Adebanjo, a suspected child molester and rapist. [reporter 2] The drama continues in this high profile two-week case. When we rang the bell, a fourteen year old girl was found at the chief's residence. It was alleged that she was raped several times over the course of three days, -by the accused. -[reporters indistinct chatter] That man should go to jail. He's a beast. Oh yes. He is definitely going in. Or, have you forgotten who the prosecuting lawyer is? Who? [reporter 3] And the prosecuting lawyer is no other person than prolific human rights activist, Ada Igwe. Ada Igwe has fought several legal battles for the less privileged. [reporter 4] Actually, it is very important to note that this… The prosecuting attorney is none other than prolific human and child rights activist, Barrister Ada Igwe. [female voice] My Lord. This is a complex case, one which the defendant ought not be granted bail because of the complexities of the charges levelled against him. Rape, assault, kidnapping. My Lord, and the battery of a minor! [Ada] So this is my submission. Chief Adebisi should not be granted bail, My Lord. Because of the complexity of this case. Barrister Ikeduba, the offences and its charges are capital offences. And therefore, the accused cannot be granted bail. Bearing this in mind, the accused shall be remanded in prison custody. Dismissed! [gavel thuds] [reporter 5] If Chief Adebanjo is found guilty of these charges, it will be Ada Igwe's eleventh successful prosecution of child molesters, in just two years. The defense lawyers on the other hand, have promised to prove the innocence of their client, and set him free-- [Chief] The whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. Do you know the young lady seated there? She's one of the recipients of my scholarship program. Have you ever been alone with Miss Mena? Not at all, never! Can you recognize those documents? This is the… copy of a… ticket, boarding pass and hotel bills of my trip to Paris. I was on a four-day conference in Paris, France. Yes, My Lord. Chief Adebisi, you said you were not in the country at the time of this offense? Yes. I was not in this country. Can you please pass this to him? [Ada] There, My Lord, is the document from the Nigerian Immigration Services, which states in black and white, the time and the date that Chief Adebisi was stamped back into this country. [Ada] through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport. In that same document, My Lord, is the flight manifest, which shows that Chief Adebisi was indeed on his friend's private jet which came in three days earlier! Three whole days earlier than he claims! [judge] In the matter of The State versus Chief Musibayo Adebanjo, I hereby find the accused guilty of multiple criminal charges. Which includes the kidnap, assault, -battery and multiple counts of rape, -[journalists indistinct chatter] of Miss Mena Nwabowan. For the offence of multiple counts of rape, this honorable court hereby sentences the accused to 14 years imprisonment. For the offence of kidnapping, the court sentences the accused to 14 years imprisonment. And finally, for the offence of assault and battery, the court sentences the accused to four years imprisonment. These sentences shall run consecutively, with hard labor. [gavel thuds] [heavy traffic, car horns honking] Madam, it seems you had a good day in court today. You're in a good mood. Oh, yes I did, Jacob. Thank you very much. [tense music continues…] Jacob, could you find a way to get us out of this terrible traffic -and, take me to the hotel? -[car horns honking] [tense music continues…] Okay, I will do that now, ma. It's just that the traffic today is so terrible. I don't know… I don't know why. [sighs] I know but, do something. Another route, anything. Just… get us out of here. [car horns honking] ‪[mouthing]‬ [sighs] I see we are in a gridlock. Okay. I've noticed we are in one spot for like ten minutes, before we move? Yes. Yes, ma. -Alright, you know what? -Yes, ma. The next time you hit the brakes, put the car on park, lock the doors and slide to the back. Madam, we are in the middle of traffic. We could get caught and we'd be in trouble. These glasses are tinted, for a reason. Do as I've said. Thank you. Yes, madam. Do it now. Let me just latch… [tense music continues…] [Ada] Touch me. -[Jacob] Madam. -Yes? -Madam. -[Ada indistinct chatter] Madam. [tense music heightens and ends] ‪[gentle music playing]‬ [Ada] Oh be assured, that every single time a child molester faces me in court, he or she will go to jail. Regardless of who their lawyer is. So, it's up to you to do the smart thing. Don't take up their cases. Maybe then you can have a shot at winning me, in court. Barrister Igwe, for such a high-profile lawyer, how could these people afford your services? Yeah, do they really pay for your services? Oh they couldn't. But we work enough for other high-profile clients to afford us the luxury, to do what we do. I want to know everything there is to know, about Barrister Ada Igwe. [gentle music continues…] -Um… Jacob. -Yes, madam? How long have you worked for me now? Err… this should be the fourth month, ma. -Hmm. And how long have we been um… -[Jacob chuckles] From the second day, madam. It was nice while it lasted, especially today. But I'm going to have to let you go. [exclaims, stutters] What have I done, madam? I've done everything you asked. You see, I'm trying to take care of a personal problem that you are standing in the way of. I'm going to tell the accountant to deposit into your account, an equivalent of three months of your salary today. And you are released. My key, please. My key. Close the door. [indistinct chatter, laughter] -Congratulations. -Congratulations, ma. -[receptionist] Congratulations, ma. -Thank you. -Get me a new driver. -Yes, ma. [Ada] My God, Ngozika, what was so urgent? And I hope you have food in this house because I'm really hungry. [Ngozika] Too bad because I've not been able to cook lately. What?! So why did you drag me down here ‪when we could have just‬ ‪had this talk somewhere and had lunch?‬ My God. And how can a culinary freak like you ‪not have food in your house?‬ I have been too depressed to cook. [scoffs] Depressed. Why are you depressed? What? You and Daniel had a fight? Ha, Zika. [in Pidgin] Or did you go to beat your mother-in-law-to-be? [laughs] [in English] I think I've messed up. I've messed everything up. Zika, what did you do? [soft piano music playing] [Zika] It was Daniel's birthday last week. And I wanted to do something special for him. So, I made his best dish, put on my favorite Victoria's Secret lingerie. Then I heard him return. -[door opens] -[indistinct chatters] [door shuts] ‪[man] Daniel?‬ [Ada laughs] Okay, stop. [laughing continues…] Are you serious right now? You tell me something funny and you don't want me to laugh? Now, I'm more embarrassed. Well, you should be. You do realize the parents own the school I teach at, right? Now, I've stopped going to work. Why would you do a thing like that? That's very unprofessional. Because I couldn't stand the thought… and the shame of constantly seeing the mother's face, on the daily. She's the proprietress of the school. And she's seen me half naked. Wow. So, what are you going to do now? I'll just find another job. I don't want to lose Daniel, though. Hmm. What has Daniel said in all of this? I haven't spoken to him. But you should. [door slams shut] -Hello, ladies. -Hey, baby. -Hi, Daniel. -Hi. What's the matter, are you alright? [sighs deeply] I just got fired. What?! What happened? I thought you were about to be made-- partner. [chuckles] I thought so too. So did I, but I was cut loose today. I was called in for a meeting just after lunch. And they said to me, "Oh, this case you're working on, is against the objectives of the firm." Oh yes, I know it's a private law firm. I know we deal with corporate clients and we deal with business law for startup companies, I know. And I admit that I just might have let my work slide just a little bit while I was working on this case, but that-- What case is this? Some useless pastor molests and impregnates a daughter of a member of the church. ‪-[Daniel laughs]‬ ‪-Hmm.‬ Anyway, the board says to me, "This is not the kind of case that brings in money for us". I said, "Oh, I will foot the bills." They should leave it to me, I will foot the bills. I told them and they said no. They insisted I stop the case, and I refused. And then they fired me. [chuckles] Those bastards fired me. I'm so sorry, baby. [Ada] Hmm! I'm so sorry, I'm sure you'll be fine. I mean, you know, in the past, firms that I have worked with as well, did not have most times, their goals aligned with mine. And, that's one of the reasons I actually started my own firm. You'll be fine. But what did you call the name of that church again? Holy Life Ministries. [defiant music playing] [phone ringing] [Ada] What? [man] Ada, why are you ignoring my calls? But what did I do wrong? Nothing. You've done nothing to me. Okay then, I want to see you. -Can I please come over? To your house? -[sighs] Please? Please? -[Ada] No. -I really need to see you. I don't want to see you, John. Ada please, I really need to see you. I don't want to see you! Ada please, [hesitating] I-- [ends call] [sighs deeply] -[tense music playing] -[crickets chirping] ‪[Dogs barking]‬ ‪[Ada] Hmm!‬ [Ada] Bastard. [Ada in a hushed voice] What… in God's name is this… idiot doing here? Jeb. How did you get into my house? What are you doing here? Ada, I just want to talk. That's all. Did I not tell you I don't want to see you? Jeb, did I not tell you I don't want to talk to you? Ada, what did I do? What did I do wrong? Tell… what did I do? Well, nothing. Until now. Do you know how creepy what you've just done is? What is wrong with this one? Ada! I miss you. [tense music continues…] [dramatic music playing] Harder. [panting] I said, harder! [yelling] Harder, dammit! I'm going hard enough, you're going to get sore. I don't care if I get sore, just go harder. -Okay, that's it. -[grunts] [dramatic music continues…] [sighs] What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm trying to prepare for sleep. [laughs] You got what you wanted. Can you please leave? Look Ada, I really wanted to see you. To talk to you, spend some time with you. I've had a very long day, Jeb. I'm very tired. -You want me to leave? -Yes. [sighs] Okay. Tomorrow, then? Oh, I don't think so. Ada, why do you treat me like this? [Jeb] Huh? Why? Why? I want to know why you treat me like this, seriously. Stop it. Just stop it, Jeb. What are you trying to do? We had an agreement. Sex only, nothing more. What is this? I know, but come on Ada. Be a little friendly. -Let me get to know you a-- -I don't want to be friendly. I don't want to get to know you. Can you please leave? Wow. [Ada] What did you call the name of the church again? [Daniel] Holy Life Ministries. [phone ringing] Yes, hello? [Zika] Hi, Ada. I need to ask a favor of you. Please. Zika, what is it? I want to know if there's an opening for a lawyer at your firm. ‎Daniel wants to work with you. Zika… I… [sighs] My law firm is not that big right now. And, I don't really think I can employ anyone of Daniel's caliber and experience, at least not for now. He doesn't mind, Ada, come on. He really wants to work for you. -[Ada] Zika-- -He's inspired by the cases you've chosen. -You must have heard about the-- -You know, um… You know how my temperament can be. You know I'm a slave driver. Ada please. I don't want to bring Daniel into that kind of situation. I really don't think it's going to work. You know, within, both of us. It's going to be too complicated. Hmm? I know, Ada, trust me, we don't mind. He doesn't mind. That's what working for someone is all about. It will mean so much to us. [in Igbo] Ada, please. Please. [in Igbo] Hello, Ada, please. [in English] Yeah, please. Hello? Yeah, sorry. What did you say? Yeah, I'm just… Please, just help us. He really needs the job, please. [sighs] Okay, Zika, I'll think about it. Gabriel Osaze? Yes, ma. Good afternoon, ma. You only have two years of experience as a driver. Yes, ma. -That was six years ago. -Yes, ma. For the last five years, a security guard? Yes, ma. Mr. Amadi? Yes, madam. You were a taxi driver? Yes, madam. For fifteen years, I drove a taxi. And I drove a bank MD for four years. Nineteen years, ma. You have nineteen years experience. Yes, ma. [laughs] So why did the bank MD fire you? [speaking in Pidgin] [in English] Mr. Amadi, Why were you fired? [speaking in Pidgin] -Chike Ozuo? -[in English] Yes, ma. [gentle music playing] You have two years experience as a driver? And your mother was your last employer? Yes, ma. Well, I had to pull out of the university, I couldn't find a job. So, I had to make do with driving her to a far away market a couple of days, to buy foodstuff. And you feel this qualifies you to be a professional driver? Yes, ma'am. I'm a very good driver. Never scratched a car, even when I carry heavy stuff. And I know Lagos like the back of my hands. I'm also a double black belt holder in Taekwondo and Judo. So with me, your security is guaranteed. Mr. Amadi, you have the job. -[soft music continues…] -Please, follow me. [Ada] So yeah, Mr. Amadi's salary, I want to have it on my table right away. [pastor speaking in tongues] [woman] Amen. -[pastor] Hey. Hmm. -[woman] Amen. -You shall bear children, hallelujah. -[woman] Amen. -Your womb shall produce children. -Amen. -In the name of Jesus Christ. -Amen. [speaking in tongues continues…] [speaking in tongues continues…] [Ada] Good afternoon, madam. [vendor] Madam, good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -[in Pidgin] You want to buy something? No, I am not here to buy anything. -[pastor praying in tongues] -Amen. -How are you? -Fine. ‪-Samantha, huh?‬ ‪-Yes.‬ [in Pidgin] What's the matter? -[pastor] I put twins inside your womb. -Ah, amen! -[pastor] I put twins inside you. -I claim it! My name is Ada Igwe. Barrister Ada Igwe. I'm a lawyer. But I specialize in child rights. I'm here to help you seek justice, for what that pastor did to your daughter, Samantha. -[pastor praying in tongues] -Amen. [pastor] So sister, [vendor] You don't know what happened to my daughter. I don't need your help, please. No, I know what happened. And you don't need to pay a dime. It is all paid for. This is where I will use the Holy Spirit inside me and put the twins inside you. -Hmm? -Okay. Madam, I don't need your help. Please, just go. -You shall receive today. Very good. Come. -Amen. Do you not want justice for your daughter? Madam, I said I don't need your help! What is this?! Please just go. Go. I don't need your help. Come on! Go, now! [softly] Wow. [dramatic music playing] [pastor] You will receive twins, you'll see. You will receive the anointing, the special anointing. [softly] Hallelujah, come on. HOLY LIFE MINISTRY [car horn honking] Um, I want to have a chat with you. Sorry, do I know you? Well, I know you. Sorry about that, I don't think I know you. That's okay, but I'm sure you know one Melanie Foster? [dramatic music plays] Madam, sorry, I don't talk to strangers. Darling, I'm sure this is one stranger, you would like to speak with. See, I know she died in one Mark Adibua's apartment, back in Minnesota, USA. And I know that Mark Adibua was under investigation, when he suddenly, mysteriously disappeared. And I know that the US government is still looking for Mark Adibua. And I happen to know exactly where he is. And I can point them, in that direction. What do you think? I didn't kill her. Madam, I swear I did not kill her. She was a drug addict. She died of a drug overdose. I had always warned her about this drug use, but she didn't listen to me. So why did you run? Her father. Her father. That man is a racist. He had always been against our relationship from the beginning so he swore to pin the death on me when she died. Well, you know, they have no clue where you are. They don't even know that you are in Lagos, Nigeria. Yet. I have a job for you. So, get in the car. Get in the car.

If you're happy this morning, shout Hallelujah! Hallelujah! -[pastor] Our God is good! -All the time! -[pastor] Our God is good! -All the time! My brothers and my sisters, this moment, join me as we welcome our General Overseer. [congregation cheers, applauds] The most revered gentleman, Pastor Duke, into the pulpit. -Good morning, saints of God! -Good morning, sir. You're welcome to church this morning. Today, we'll be speaking on the topic of grace. God's grace in our lives. You see, God's grace is already upon all of us seated here this morning. And all we need to do, is just accept it into our lives. And He will begin to work wonders for us. But before we can do that, we must rid ourselves of all fleshly desires. And abstain from getting roped into things of this world, that so easily beset us. -We need to keep ourselves holy, -Hypocrite. for our Heavenly Father, -so that we may seat in heaven. -[sighs] Can't take this rubbish anymore. [pastor] So, my brethren, ‪we need to keep away‬ ‪from such things that rope us‬ into the desires, ‪-into the base desires of this world.‬ ‪-[Ada] I can't take this rubbish anymore.‬ [pastor] That is what we do, [pastor in background] to accept the grace of God into our lives [dramatic music playing] [pastor in background] We need to take cognizance of God's grace, and there is good for your bond in our lives. We need to keep ourselves holy, before our Heavenly Father. So that we may see heaven. The Bible says in the book of Corinthians: "Let fornication and adultery, and all fleshly desires not even be mentioned, amongst you, such as are becoming of saints". That is a reprove for us, in the present day, that such things should not be mentioned in our gatherings. Then, and only then, can His grace abound upon all… our… -[congregation clamoring] -All-- -[congregation yelling and murmuring] -[male voice] Are you seeing that? Ushers! Where are the ushers? [pastor] Turn that thing off! [clamoring continues…] Ushers, turn this thing off! [dramatic music playing] [congregation murmuring] Calm down, calm down. -[man] No! I can't. -[congregation protesting] Imagine, my own wife? My own wife? [husband] No, sir, I cannot take it! -My own wife? Look! -Calm down. -No, no, I cannot take it!. -[protests continues…] -My own wife? My own wife? -[church members indistinct chatter] [husband] Can you see that? Can you see that? -[pastor2] Do you believe it was Satan? -[husband] No, no. My own wife? -[husband] No! I cannot take this! -[congregation protesting] -This is an operation perfectly executed. -Hmm. I mean, it's different from the way lawyers I know handle cases. ‪Well…‬ Is this still going to court? Oh, definitely. It's a criminal case. May I ask you? What inspires you? I mean, what's your driving force? Cause whatever it is, it is strong. Justice! Justice? -Mm-hmm. -Is that it? Don't they deserve justice? They do. The poor and the vulnerable ones, they are always taken advantage of. It fuels my rage. It's perceived. Like they have no voice. No identity. I choose to… to be their voice. That's very noble of you. And… and I'm glad to be part of this legacy of yours. Hmm. Thank you. [scoffs] Daniel, you're welcome. [soft music playing] ‪[sighs]‬ ‪[chuckles]‬ You know, this is a dream come true for me. [Ada sighs] I confess, I've always fantasized about you secretly. [sighs] I feel really disgusted about this, though. Daniel, I mean… [sighs] I feel really filthy right now. No! Ada, no. You shouldn't feel that way. This is not an accident. [Ada grunts] This right here is not a coincidence. Hmm. We are meant to be, can't you see? We have so many things in common. You like children, I like children. You're a lawyer, I am a lawyer. You're a fighter and I respect that. I think it's the best thing. ‪I think the fact‬ ‪that we are alike just makes it amazing.‬ Ada, you know what I see? I see a king, and I see a queen. And together, I know we can conquer the world. ‪[sighs]‬ I need you to promise me something, though. Anything. Zika must not know about this. Zika will not know about this. No, I need you to promise me. I promise you that Zika will not know about this. [sighs] Madam! Madam! [emotionally] Madam! [speaking in Pidgin] [laughs] Really? Yes. [speaking in Pidgin] Your daughter. How old is she? ‪Hmm.‬ [man] My Lord, we have an application for bail before you on the grounds that the accused, is not in good health. Therefore I pray, that Mr. Taofeek Ajiwole be granted bail for him to seek urgent medical attention, immediately. My Lord. I ask that request of the defense counsel, not be granted on these grounds. One, the severity of the case at hand. My Lord, this is a rape case. Two, the safety of the victim. My Lord, the accused is the landlord of the victim. And they both will be returning to the same premises. This could cause intimidation on the part of the victim. And three, My Lord, the accused has not tendered to this honorable court, any proof of ill health. Therefore, My Lord, I ask that you remand the accused in custody. My Lord, Mr. Taofeek Ajiwole has no history of violence whatsoever. And, he is in a critical condition that requires urgent medical attention. Oh come on, My Lord, there is no evidence stating-- Counsel! Hold yourself together. I hereby grant the accused bail, on the following conditions. That he submits his international passport, provides one surety, and a medical report. And of course, 50,000 naira bail. Fifty thousand naira! My Lord, that is preposterous! Counsel, one more word, I hold you in contempt. This case is adjourned till 27th December. The court is adjourned. [gavel thuds] -[judge] Arise. -[bailiff] Court! [murmuring] ‪[indistinct chatter]‬ [Ada] Listen to me, madam. Just ignore him. No, do you understand? Leave, do… [sighs] -Okay, I understand, I understand. -[yelps] [Ada] Just ignore him. He is just rambling -[yelps] What nonsense is thia? -and enjoying his last days of freedom. Ignore him. Whatever he says, ignore him. I will take care of him. Just make sure you bring… [tense music playing] ‪[Ada sighs]‬ your daughter to court, do you understand me? [sighs] Alright, um. I have to go. I'll call you later at night. I'm sure you'll be fine, okay? Just take care of your daughter. Okay.

[speaking in Yoruba] [in Yoruba] Don't you also know that… Hey. [in Yoruba] What is the problem? [Ada's voice speaking indistinctly in background] ‪[Ada's voice in English]‎So it's up to you‬ ‎to do this whole thing. ‎To take up these cases. ‎Maybe, just maybe then, ‎we could have a shot. ‎At least with me, I'm talking about. ‎As a country, the only way I think ‎that we could move forward is that ‎we accommodate ‎the less privileged ones in our society. ‎They deserve and have a right ‎to legal representation ‎from the government, when it can be found. Nurturing and caring for children, are the corner stones of human progress. Now, my organization, the "Hope For All" foundation, was built with this very purpose in mind. Over the years, we have worked hand-in-hand with UNICEF. To overcome the obstacles that violence, poverty, disease, and discrimination, place on a child's path. We believe in promoting girls' education. We ensure that they complete primary education, as a minimum. We believe we can all together advance the cause of humanity. And tonight, we call on all of you here present today, to give whatever support you can, to this cause. And of course, uh, ladies and gentlemen, please permit me, but uh, [clears throat] I have just recognized the presence of a shining light of this generation. Here in this room. A woman who has put herself in the forefront of giving justice to the underprivileged. Especially abused women and children. A profound lawyer. Please, permit me to recognize the presence. And please help me to welcome Barrister Ada Igwe. -[laughs] -[applause] Thank you. Thank you. [applause continues…] [indistinct conversations] The Jonas brothers. Thank you. -Ah! Chief. -Great work you're doing. Thank you. I will donate one million dollars. -My chief. My chief. -Yeah, yeah. -I will do that. -Thank you very much. -Thank you. -[Ada] It's amazing. Must be really nice. -Hello. -Oh, hi. Hi. -Ah, Mrs. Johnson. How are you? -I'm fine. -I should-- -She donated 10,000 dollars today. Really? Ten thousand dollars? That's fantastic.

You do.‬ Well, I hope that's uh-- No, no, more beautiful, I mean. Ah, thank you, because I was about to ask. ‪[both laugh]‬ Yes. A very successful event you just had. -Thank you. Thank you very much. -Congratulations. [clears throat] ‪So what do you do when you're not‬ ‪throwing sex offenders in jail?‬ [laughs] Nothing really. I mean, I hang out with my sisters, have drinks… And er, pretty much, I don't go out. I don't have friends. -I live a very boring life after work. -Really? That's interesting. [Ada] Ah! Mr Ighodaro. What a present surprise. Oh, please. Please. Call me Timothy. I must apologize for barging in on you like this, but it's become a hobby of mine to do that to family and friends. Now and then. [both laugh] -What an interesting hobby. -[laughs] Please… sit. [both laugh] -Drinks? -Yes. -Champagne? -Great. Brenda, get um… Mr Ighodaro a bottle of Dom Pérignon. -Dom Pérignon, huh? -Mm-hmm. What are we celebrating? You! It's not easy to have the great Timothy Ighodaro in my office, now is it? Oh please, please. Where I come from, we only celebrate invited visitors. Not people that barge in on us. Well, I think we come from the same place. -[laughs] -But I'll make this exception for once. [both laugh] So… -[mobile phone ringing] -Oh, excuse me. Yeah. Yes? ‪[tense music playing]‬ What? What happened to her? [sighs] Okay, I'm coming there right away. Is everything okay? Um… no. Um… A child client of mine has just gotten into trouble at her school. And I have to go there right away. Oh. -Um… -Yeah. So, I have to go there. Well, let me drive you home then. Oh no, not at all. You don't need to worry. My driver is just right outside. And I'm sure you have better things to do. Oh no, no. It'd be my pleasure. I insist. [tense music continues…] This is ridiculous. It's a bad situation, Ada. -One of the students just called me. -[Ada] What happened? I don't know, just go that way. Since you brought her to this school four months ago, -it's been one scandal after another. -[sniffles] She's reclusive, she does not contribute in class. She does not assist to relate to fellow students. To top it all. Today, she was caught in the toilet -with two male students. -[sniffles] [sobbing] I'm afraid I have no other option than to expel her. I understand. Mena needs special help. No. She needs prayers. -Are you alright? -Yes, ma. [soft music playing] What happened? I don't know what happened. I just couldn't control myself. And the boys could not keep their hands away from me. [soft music continues…] Get into the car. Him, too. Who, him? Yes. Who is he? That's Mr. Ossai, the math teacher. Get into the car. Who is he? [Mena] Mr. Ossai, the math teacher. [soft music continues…] You put your hands on a child? Well, you better get yourself a damn good lawyer. -And still pack your bags. -[spluttering] -Excuse me! -[man] Madam. Do you know what is happening in your school? This damn man, Mr. Ossai, was one of those that raped that girl? [trembling] Mr. James, don't believe her. I didn't do anything. -Ossai? -You, too? -Don't believe… I didn't do anything. -Oh my God. Well, you better get the police to get him. Otherwise, this school will burn. And I will see to that. -Mr. James. -Oh my God, where is the gateman? Rabiu! Come here, come here! Hey! Rabiu, get him! -[Mr. Ossai grunts] [yelps] God. -Get him! Don't allow Ossai to leave this school until the police comes. [Mr. James] Oh my God. We need to call the police. [Mr. Ossai] I didn't do anything. -[Mr. James] Hello? -[Mr. Ossai] Madam. You are a disgrace to this school. Take him to the principal's office! -Hello, DPO. I've got your criminal here. -She came to me. She's not still-- I say take him to the principal's office! You are a disgrace to this… Hello? DPO, yes? [Mr. Ossai] I didn't do anything! -Are you okay? -[softly] Wow. -[Mr. Ossai protesting] -[Mr. James] Alright, sir. -Wow. -[Mr. James] You're a disgrace! [Mr. Ossai] I didn't do anything! Aunty Ada… I think something is wrong with me. Mena, we're going to go get something to eat. And then, uh, we're going to go see a friend of mine. Okay? Okay. I was 12. I was top of my class in primary school. But my parents could not afford to pay for my secondary school education. At that time, my dad was very sick. So someone introduced my mom to Chief Adebisi, as the man that would help with my school fees. And he said I needed to come for an interview. After the interview, they said I passed. And that I would wait for training. So my mom left me there. Every night… Every night, when Chief came back from work, [Mena sniffles] he would come to our room and he would ask us to take off our clothes. And if you don't take off your clothes, [sobs] he would beat you. [sobs] Ada. -[softly] Mena. -[sobs] Hey. You'll be alright, okay? Give me one minute. [Mena sniffles] Hey. -Ada. -[sighs] Ada. She's gonna end up like me. No, she's not. She's got help early and that's because of you. In your own case, you developed a coping mechanism. That's why your mind works the way it works. I think you should use my treatment. I mean, how's she going to cope? -She's not going to survive. -Nope. No, no, no. -You need to try out the alter ego. -No, it didn't work. What do you mean, "It didn't work."? Look at how you turned out. I told you, that creating alter egos is escapism. It doesn't work. Not medical. But, I'm a lawyer, I'm successful. Yes, that's one. One of the personalities you created. The other personality, Roxanne, is going about doing all kinds of things. [sighs] I warned you. I warned you it wasn't going to work. Creating multiple personalities is not a way to deal with pain. I... what else did you want me to do? We had standard-- It wasn't working! -We had treatment plans for you. -It wasn't working! You didn't follow it! [exclaims in frustration] See, what's important now is to follow your treatment plan. -Fight Ada, fight! Still fight! -I've been fighting. My life is a mess! Ada keep fighting. -[Mena sniffles] -[Ada] I need to get some air, I'll… I'll be back. [soft music playing] Ada! Ada! Ada! [soft music swells] [Mr. Ighodaro] Quite some affection you have for that young girl. You two have blood ties? Do I have to have blood ties with someone before I feel their pain? Oh, no you don't. It's just that. [sighs] I feel like I wanna get to know you on a… a deeper level. So, I'm just curious. Is Mena related to you in some way? No. Really? It's just that, I could have sworn otherwise. Feels to me like you have some kind of special bond with her. It… It's about something she represents. Abused children? One abused child. Me. [dramatic music note] Oh… wait. You were abused? [sighs] [Ada sighs] I was 13. JS Two. My parents were the busiest in the world. My mother had just started her rice importation business and my… my father was a court judge. It was my mother's duty to pick me up from school. She always ran late. Every damn time, she would run late. I would be the only one left in school, for hours. [laughs] There seemed to be this teacher. PE teacher. Physical Education. He would wait hours after school with me. For hours, till my mom would come pick me up. Sometimes, he would even volunteer to drop me off at her store. My mom loved him. Oh, why won't she? Then one day, he took me to a staffroom. Then he started to talk to me the way he's never spoken to me before. He started to touch me. And he made me touch him. He showed me his privates and… I just… I knew something wasn't right, I screamed. I yelled, I scratched, I… It was no use. Because no one was there. [laughs] He forced himself on me that day. That was just the beginning. He did it frequently. I… I lost count. I would beg my mom. I would beg my mom never… please don't come late. Just don't come late, not even one second. She would come late every single damn time. Every damn time. And allowed that beast put his hands on me. He did it so much. By the time I turned fourteen, I'd already gotten used to it. But why didn't you tell anyone else? I couldn't. He, he threatened me. I was so young. What did I know? He said, if I ever told anyone, he would turn it all on me. And that he would make sure I never got into any other school again. I was so afraid. Even when I summoned the courage to try and tell someone, my parents were always so busy, they were just never there. I was so scared. I just… I just kept it to myself. It became my own secret. My dirty little secret. But what about the first teacher, the Physical Education teacher. The one that… that beast! The one that touched you, that defiled you. What happened to him? You know, I don't, uh… Let's just, end this right now. I don't want to talk about this anymore. -Ada, listen to me, you have to talk-- -I said I don't want to talk about it. -You have to talk about. -I don't want to talk about it! You have to talk about it! [sighs] [sobs] I can't summon the courage to face that guy. In a weird way, I think I'm really still afraid of him. [sobs] Look… you're not afraid of him. You're afraid of how it would make you feel. I mean, you've spent your whole life throwing sex offenders behind jail. And the one man that defiled you is walking this earth a free man? You know, he might be dead. -He might just be dead. -Yeah, yeah. -I think he's dead. -Yeah, he might be. Or he might be living in a palatial mansion, somewhere on Banana Island. Happy. Free. Completely unaware of all the atrocities he has caused. Huh? [sobbing] Either which way, it doesn't matter. -[Ada sobbing heavily] -[sighs] [Ada] I can't face him. [sobs] I can't face him. I can't. [sobbing] You have a letter. Okay. A letter. ‪[tense music plays]‬ [woman sighs] [soft piano music playing] I think she has her reasons for this. My sister is actually a nice person. Okay? And, six months salary? Baby, with this you can take your time and get a good job. Don't be so sad, please. Okay? [sighs] I'm tired, I'm going out for a drink. Yeah, let's go. No. [soft music playing] [whistling] Madam, good morning. ‪[whistling]‬ Peter. [speaking in Pidgin] There! That's your salary. You can take it and don't come back. [speaking in Pidgin] You're relieved, Peter. Take it! [car horn honks] Okay, ma. But madam… [soft music playing] [Ada] This is a lovely place. Yep. It's one of the best. They have some of the best chefs in the city. I'm just thinking how I'm going to take one of them to my house. [both laugh] It's a lucky thing for us here that none of the chefs come out to serve us. Oh yeah, well, unfortunately for them, every time that door opens, I'm always trying to take a peek in to see if I can catch a glimpse but I never do. Hmm. You should try and cook some time. -Me? -It's not so hard. Cook? Really? [laughs] Listen. Once, in university, I tried to boil some rice, ‪-Mm-hmm.‬ ‪-and I nearly burned down the hostel. Yes.‬ -[laughing] Oh, really? -Really. Just rice? -Yeah, just rice. -[laughs] Cooking? Count me out. Well, I should remember that. What about you? Do you cook? Let's just say, I can give all your chefs here a run for their money. -Oh, yeah? -But I hardly cook these days. ‪I've been… schedule's just horrendous.‬ Oh, I understand. Too many criminal cases on your plate. [sighs] But I admire your passion. Very much. Thank you. Oh, look at you. See who's talking. You have taken charity to a whole new level. And I'm sure UNICEF is extremely proud ‪to be working‬ ‪with you and your organization.‬ Oh, you know, there's a lot of hungry children in the world. But hey, I have a proposal for you, okay? Let's synergize, let's work together. Let's merge our forces, okay? I will provide food, clothing, education for the children. And you give them justice. I can get UNICEF to support your work, too. I love that. I really do. It's a great idea. You'd give me the honors? Do you the honors? [laughs] It's a privilege. Thank you very much. Great! Let's toast then. To a new era. Sure. To a new… [glass clinks] [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] -[Mr. Ighodaro] How are you? -[crowd chatter] [children chanting] [Mr. Ighodaro] Everybody calm down. [Mr. Ighodaro] Everybody calm down. ‪-Okay, okay.‬ ‪-[crowd chatters]‬ [Mr. Ighodaro] How are you? -[policeman] Hey! -[children] Daddy! [Mr. Ighodaro] We're going to have Indomie instead. ‪[tense music playing]‬ Everybody calm down. [Mr. Ighodaro] Everybody calm down. Calm down, calm down. -Calm down! -[policeman] Okay, okay. [Mr. Ighodaro] Everybody calm down. [tense music continues…] [Mr. Ighodaro] How are you? [Mr. Ighodaro] Okay, okay. Everybody, calm down. [tense music continues…] Hey. Are you okay? Why are you not with everybody else? Come, come. There's… Hey! Hey, wait! ‪[mouths] Wow.‬ [sighs] -Hey. -Hey. You don't look like you're having fun here. I am. It's just that-- Just what? -Remember that girl I saw at the IDP camp? -Mm-hmm. I can't shake her off my mind. It's… something. She just seemed so… so lost. So abused. I can't get my mind off her. And believe me, my gut feeling tells me there's something. ‪There's more to it.‬ [sighs] Ada. Everyone in that camp has been through some trauma or another, you know. Some have lost siblings, friends… ‪-fathers.‬ ‪-Yeah.‬ Yeah? It's a sad place. It's a very sad place. -I know. -Yeah? You know what? I'm not gonna take you there again. What?! No, no. Please don't say that. Please, don't. ‪[sighs]‬ [children chanting] Mr. Timothy! [crowd chatters] [people in crowd quarrel] -[Mr. Ighodaro] Take it easy. -[policeman] Take it easy! Take it easy. Wait, everybody. Wait! [voices in crowd] Hey, hey! -[Mr. Ighodaro] Take it easy. -[people shouting] [tense music playing] [Ada] Hey, wait! [Ada] Why are you always running? Wait, wait! -[voice in crowd] Hey! Hey! -[Mr. Ighodaro] Take it easy. Wait! ‪[tense music continues…]‬ Where are you going? Wait! Wait! Why are you always running? Are you okay? Look, everyone is having fun out there. But you're… Hey. Why are you so bruised? What's going on? Look, if anyone is abusing you here, I can help you. Talk to me, okay? I want to be your friend. I can't be your friend. [scoffs] Of course you can be my friend. I want to be your friend. Look, talk to me. What's going on? I can't be your friend because he's your friend. He, who? Who's my friend? -Hey, there you are. -Hi. I've been looking everywhere for you. You almost gave me a heart attack. Look listen, don't go anywhere without letting any of the security operatives know, okay? -I mean, it could be dangerous out here. -I know. We got to get going, it's getting late… come on. -I know but I wanna, I need to… -Come on, let's go. -Come on. -[softly] Come. -[Ada sighs] -[Mr. Ighodalo] It's okay. Come on. It's getting late, we can lose our flight. I know but… [plane engine roaring] -[wistful music playing] -[silent chatter] [plane engine roaring] [pilot on PA system] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard flight 1101. Our estimated time of arrival will be sixteen oh five GMT. Care to sit back while we give you a break, and enjoy the ride on the… [soft music playing] ‪-[wistful music playing]‬ ‪-[silent chatter]‬ Come! Where, where is she? Come! -Come! -Where are we going? [wistful music playing] [indistinct chatter in the distance] [Ada] Aisha, what are you doing all by yourself in this place? Why are you hiding? Yeah. Aisha, look at your face. You actually have more bruises than the last time I was here. Who is doing this to you? No one. I… I fell down while I was playing. No one, it's just very rough here. Aisha, talk to me. I can help you. I can protect you. I've already said too much. I think they're going to kill me. Who? Who's going to kill you? [whimpers in fright, pants] Aisha! Aisha! [crickets chirping] [tense music playing] -[man] Shh. -[Aisha whimpering softly] Aisha. Yes? Don't worry, you're fine. Are you okay? Yes I am. Sorry about that. That was for your own protection, okay? Yes. You're safe here, okay? Remember I told you that I will protect you? You'll be safe here now, okay? Okay. But my brother, he's still there. -Your brother? -Yes. Hmm? [sighing] Okay. [Ada] Talk to me. It's him. [Ada] Him, who? It's your friend. Mr. Timothy Ighodaro. [dramatic music begins] He's been raping me, for a few years now. I'm his… sex slave. What?! What did you just say? No, this is why I didn't want to tell you. I… I knew you would not believe me. No, what did you just say? Timothy Ighodaro? Do you know that that is a very, very respectable person in the society? This is someone who has helped you, and others out of sticky situations. Even rape victims. How can you say such a person raped you! See, I don't want to cause any problem between you two, please. Are you serious? You're serious. A few years ago, my family including my parents, were killed in cold blood. By insurgents. Mr. Timothy's foundation took about a hundred of us to one hotel in Kubwa Town. We were very happy. We were grateful. My brother and I, because… he said he would pay our school fees. He would, he paid for everything we basically needed there at that point but… but from the first night in that hostel, Mr. Timothy forced himself on me. And when I refused, he raped me. After beating me mercilessly. He also threatened me, that if I tell anyone. He would remove my brother and I from school and we couldn't afford to, not to go to school. Especially my little brother. And he would kick us out, too. So… Eventually, we had to move to the IDP camp because they had to close the hostel for renovations. And, I was happy because he stopped showing up. Then the other day, he showed up with you. [Mr. Ighodaro] Everybody calm down. Calm down. And I just knew, I knew that the torture would begin again. Three days ago, he came back to the IDP camp. [sobbing] I'm begging you. You are my property. -I own you. Shut up! -[sobbing] Please. -[screams] -Come here. [screams] [wistful music continues…] My friend used to take these photos whenever he would come to the hostel. To molest the ladies. [wistful music playing] ‪[breathing heavily]‬ [Aisha] Your friend is not who you think he is. Or who the world thinks he is. He's a very, very bad man. [sighs] Ada, you don' t know the extent girls of today would go to, to snatch a man from you. And if they can't, Ada, if they can't, they tarnish his image. Timothy, a rapist? No. Ah, no. I don't believe it. No. Zika, I have been in this job long enough to know that people are usually not what they seem to be. Believe me, everyone has a demon. No one is exempt. [sighs] Not even me. Hey, hey. You're letting this love trap catch you. Timothy's name is gonna be cleared real soon. Okay? Just calm down. And to think I was beginning to really fall for this man. I mean, I don't even think I've felt this way, for any man before. I mean, what kind of luck is this? This is really bad. -This is really bad. -I know. [sighs] I know. Timothy's name is gonna be cleared, okay? It will be sorted out. [sighs] I have to go. Where are you going to? Why are you leaving me? Relax. I don't want Daniel to meet me here. Why? There's no problem. You're my sister. Just what's that, now? Well, because I fired him. Forget about it, he's fine. [laughs] He's fine, okay? Let me make you something to eat. Food is ready. Ada. Food is ready, Ada. [phone message tone] Aw. ‪Wow.‬ [giggles] Ada. [phone message tone] [phone message tone] [phone message tone] -[yells] Ada! -Shit! ‪What is it?‬ What do you mean? You've been sleeping with Daniel, Ada. Have you been sleeping with Daniel? Have you been…? Ada you've been… God, Ada I'm so scared of you. Jesus, Ada you have a deep… Ada, you… [yelling] Get up! Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Get out of my house, Ada. [emotionally] Get out of my house. [sobbing] I'm so scared of you, right now.

I thought long and hard about this. You... are the only woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. What are you doing? Ada Igwe, will you marry me? [violin music continues…] Please ask them to stop. You don't like the music? -Tell them to stop now. -Why, you don't like the music? [yells] Stop! What's wrong? [sighs] ‪[tense music playing]‬ Timothy. Do you recognize that picture? [tense music continues…] Where? You do know her, don't you? Ada. -Wow. -Ada. -Ada. -[Ada] You couldn't even close your legs. Ada! Ada! [violin music continues…] [yelling] Shut the fuck up! You stalking me now? Ada, we need to talk. Can we go somewhere private, where we can talk? No. I don't wanna go anywhere private with you. I have a client to meet. Please… Ada, please don't do this! You can't possibly tell me you believe that girl's story. No, I shouldn't? No, you shouldn't! -Really? -Yes, really. You want me to turn a deaf ear to a rape allegation with hard fact? Yes, you should. You know why? -Why. -Because I am involved, that's why. -Oh, really. -Yes, really. I will do the same for you if it was the other way around. Whether the story is true or not. So it is true then, isn't it? Timothy? Tell me! Did you sexually abuse that girl for six months, Timothy? Did you? Did you turn her to your sex slave? ‪[scoffs]‬ [sighs] You know I know that you were in Abuja. All the time when that was happening, right? I hope you remember that. And she showed me pictures of whatever it was that you guys were doing back then. Look, everyone I've helped has pictures of me, okay? I take pictures with people. That's what I do. In compromising positions, Timothy? Baby, baby, listen to me, okay? Listen to me, alright? You shared your story with me. I listened, I understood. I cried with you, I felt your pain. Now I want you to hear my story too. And give me the same understanding and empathy, okay? Okay? [sighs] I was sexually abused as a child, as well. Yes. By my nanny. Between the ages of twelve to eighteen, I was repeatedly sexually abused by that demon! And like most abused children, I am suffering the after effects -of repeated sexual abuse. -[laughs] I'm sure you're familiar with that condition. [laughing] Are you kidding me? Timothy, raping and assaulting people, are not side effects of sexual abuse, Timothy. And having suffered the consequences, the humiliation and the degradation of sexual abuse, how could you possibly do that to another human being?! I didn't rape her. [exclaims in frustration] -We had consensual sex before, okay? -Ugh! Yeah, but then she met some small boy, and refused my advances. I… I got mad. I… I lost control. I listened to the voice notes, Timothy. You raped her! You did! And to think I was in Lagos, waiting for you. Craving your touch. Timothy. And you were in Abuja, raping one of your beneficiaries? [sighs] You disgust me. Hey! Don't go all self- righteous on me, okay? Because I know you, Ada Igwe. I know you, okay? I had you investigated long before I met you, okay? I know everything about you. You're a nymphomaniac, and you're a sex pervert! Yes! You take advantage. of your position in society. To lure young men into having sex with you. You pay them for sex, okay? I knew all of these things about you, even before we met! But… you opened up to me about how you were abused as a child, it immediately made sense to me. And I just feel that you'll understand me in the same way. Because we've experienced all of these horrible things ‪and it's given us all crazy urges.‬ Turned us all into sex offenders. The only difference is, you and I are trying to make up for our offenses. The only sex offender in this place right here, right now, is you, Timothy. You! How dare you? How dare you think you can turn this whole thing around to your own advantage, Timothy? I am a lawyer. And I know, that having consensual sex with multiple male partners, is not a crime. No. Yes. I am a sex addict. Yes. I have PTSD. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. But you know what? I am doing something about it. What are you doing, Timothy? You rape people. You molest people. And you, do not feel any remorse, for your crimes. You even tried to have that girl killed! And her younger brother. Who the hell are you? And you tried to turn this whole thing around? No. You and I are not the same. We are not the same, Timothy. I wish you well, Timothy. I really do. She's going to press charges. Good luck. You really wanna go down that road? Do you? Huh? I know that you will not be able to face me in court. Will you? Darling? Hmm? Hmm. You know, I wasn't going to. I didn't think I could. But after this statement of yours, Timothy Ighodaro, see you in court. [soft music heightens] ‪Excuse me.‬ You really think you can bring down a man of my caliber? A man of my connections? You know who I am? I'm talking to you. If I sink, I will sink with you! Come back here! Bitch! [reporter] Having heard the testimonies from the state witness, Miss Aisha Mohammed, and the accused, Mr. Timothy Ighodaro, the defense counsel will be presenting evidence to prove Mr. Timothy Ighodaro's innocence. Counsel, you may proceed. Your Honor, there is no case here. It is unfortunate that the counsel has decided to disrespect this honorable court and all present here, with this ridiculous law suit. These proceedings will be a total waste of time as we are here simply as a result of a woman's quest, for vengeance. Yes. The prosecuting lawyer, Miss Ada Igwe, has decided to use the law, as a tool of vengeance to get back at my client because he broke off their… engagement. -Objection, My Lord! -[court] Hmm? Relevance? Objection overruled! Counsel, proceed. This case is only in court, as Ada Igwe has a grudge. Because she is [laughs] broken-hearted. But she has crossed the legal line, by deciding to use one of the beneficiaries of the accused, in order to keep him in court. Objection, My Lord. Overruled! Let her make her point. You will have your chance soon. Counsel, you may proceed. During the course of this sham, Your Honor. I will produce witnesses that will testify to the fact that Miss Ada Igwe is nothing but a nymphomaniac, with an insatiable sexual appetite, who uses men and then dumps them. This is exactly what my client discovered when he decided to call off the relationship. Now, I ask you this question. Are we going to allow Miss Ada Igwe, the prosecuting counsel, to use this good court as a tool of vengeance? This is just reaching us. The trial has turned on its head. Who is Ada Igwe, really? The case is no longer about Aisha the helpless teenager, who was allegedly raped by philanthropist-activist, Timothy Ighodaro. Ada Igwe's reputation is now on trial. My Lord, I hereby call on my next witness, Mr. Daniel Peters. [dramatic music playing] Mr. Daniel Peters, are you a Christian or a Muslim? A Christian. [bailiff] Lay your hand… Do you swear that the evidence you shall give this court, shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? I swear. [defense attorney] Mr. Peters, please tell the court what your relationship is with the prosecutor. I was a member of her staff for six weeks. What kind of staff? I was a lawyer at her firm. Is that all you did for her? No. Please tell the court what other services you rendered for Miss Igwe. We had sex. Everyday. And whenever I declined, she threatened me. Threatened you? What kind of threat did you receive from Miss Ada Igwe? To tell my fiancé, her sister, that I was sleeping with her. Or, she was going to pin some sort of crime on me. Threatened to pin a crime on you? Yes. My Lord, this is exactly why we are gathered here. To try an innocent man that Miss Ada Igwe has pinned a crime on! I have no further questions for this witness. Counsel, would you like to cross-examine the witness? [tense music playing] ‪[sighs]‬ No, My Lord. Okay. [defense attorney] Your Honor, I hereby call upon my second witness, Miss Ngozika Igwe. Miss Igwe, please tell the court what your relationship is, with the prosecutor. Adaeze is my sister. Please describe the kind of person Ada Igwe is. Ada is very selfish, bitter, and also an over ambitious person. I've tried several times to stop her from pinning false accusations on that innocent man. But she was bent on getting back at him. Just because he dumped her. I have no further questions for this witness. How does it feel? Ngozika. -My dear sister. -Don't call me that. I'm not your sister. Zika, you will go this far to carry out your revenge on me? I accept I deserve this. I really messed up. I accept. You know I can go in there, and fight this case to the end, and I will win it. But any counter argument from me right now, will see you and Daniel go into jail for contempt of court. So, I have decided to sacrifice this case for your freedom. But Zika, I want you to know, that you have denied a young girl of justice today. Just for your bid to get back at me. You have everything. Everything, Ada. You have money. You have a great job. You have recognition. Everything! You have men. Loads of, loads of them. But me, what do I have? What I had was Daniel. But you had to, you had to have him. You just had to have him, you had… No. Zika, I made a horrible, horrible mistake. But I didn't. It wasn't intentional. I… I couldn't help myself. There's, there's something in me I can't… I can't control it. But I tried. I laid him off. I... I tried to stay away from him, I... Zika, I am truly sorry. I would never want to hurt you, you know that. I love you. Please forgive me, I don't want to lose you. Please. I'm sorry. No, you're not. You're not sorry. But you'll soon be. Zika. [sighs] Excuse me, ma. What?! [tense music playing] [indistinct chatter] Did you, did you see that? [sobbing] Oh my goodness, he's going to kill me. Don't worry. Don't worry. [crying] He's going to kill me. You. You promised to protect me. You promised to help me. You should have just let me be, from the first day. But, now see. You have just completely ruined my life, and my brother's. Now, oh God. Now, the whole world knows I've been raped. And now that man, my life is in danger from that man. Because of you! Aisha, I'm sorry, I really am. But sometimes, we lose cases, too. Are you hearing this? You're sorry? You're sorry? That's it. That's it? Please, leave me alone. You've ruined our lives, madam. [tense music continues…] Where are the other girls? I met Timothy at his foundation. The "Hope For All" foundation. He helped me and my family, off the street. And also provided funding for my education. And after that, he demanded that I be in a relationship with him. Otherwise, he would cut off our benefits. And send me and my family back to the street. So he started having sex with me. Everyday, any day, and any time he wanted it. He was very rough, and he treated me like an animal. He would slap me, sometimes ties me with a rope. And do all sorts of strange things to my body. When he sees me with a boy, even if the boy was a family member. He would beat me up for days. He's been having sex with me for seven years now. My Lord. The defense counsel has tried to distract this honorable court today, by making this all about me. About my person. And having witnesses speak lies under oath. But the truth is, My Lord, that we are here today to seek justice for one victim. Miss Aisha Mohammed. Who was sexually abused and battered physically for years, by the accused. [Ada] My Lord, the accused, Mr Timothy Ighodaro. has used his foundation for years, as a cover for his devilish deeds. Brutalizing and torturing women and often times children, who have come to him, for vital help. The prosecuting counsel has a warrant for the accused's sperm, to cross reference with a sample obtained from the victim. To prove beyond all reasonable doubt, that Mr. Timothy Ighodaro, the accused, raped Miss Aisha Mohammed. [Ada] The defense counsel and the accused, have acted in complete disregard of the law here today, My Lord. But I pray this court ensures that justice is served. -[tense music heightens] -[crowd clamoring] [wistful music playing] -He might just be dead. I think he's dead. -Yeah, yeah. Yeah, he might be. Or he might be living in a palatial mansion, somewhere on Banana Island. Happy. Free. [Ada] I can't summon the courage to face that guy. In a weird way, I think I'm really still afraid of him. [sobs] [wistful music continues…] ‪-[wistful music continues…]‬ ‪-[silent chatter]‬ [man in Yoruba] Who is that? I said, who is that? [in English] Who is that? Oh. Death, have you finally come for me? For nothing of life, and nothing that breathes, has ever walked through that door to care for me. I ask again. Death, have you come for me? For I seek you everyday of my life. Who are you? What do you want? Who do you seek? Woman, who are you? [sighs] Mr. Kolade. PE teacher. Holy Rock Secondary School. June 12, 1993. You forced your filthy self on an innocent girl. A naïve girl. A young girl. Her mother trusted you. She trusted you. Why? Why me? Why did you pick me? You sexually assaulted me. Raped me, continuously. Changed the course of my life, forever. You created this, this monster in me. Ada Igwe? Oh! I wish this day had come earlier. And I had asked for your forgiveness. Maybe. Just maybe, my life wouldn't have been this miserable. When you left the school, I… I… tried to rape another young girl. But I was caught. And faced the wrath of jungle justice. Even so. I spent 14 years of my life in jail. When I was released from prison, I was sick, homeless. And hopeless. Strangers feed me with their crumbs. My daughter. Please. I pray you, forgive me, forgive me. Don't you ever, ever, ever call me that again. [yells] Don't you ever call me that again! [gasps] [strained breathing] [very softly] Never! [strained breathing continues…] [haunting music playing] [gun clicks] [gasping in fright] [Ada breathing heavily] [grasping for air] [sobbing] [Mr. Kolade grasping for air] [sobbing] Oh. [Ada sobbing] [sobbing] ‪[sighs]‬ I came to send you to hell. [breathes heavily] I can see you are already in hell. You are already in hell. [Ada sobbing] [Mr. Kolade grasping for air] [wistful music continues…] [screaming] [wistful music heightens] [fast-paced haunting music plays] Translated by HIVENTY
