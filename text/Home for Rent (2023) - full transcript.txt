THE IGNORANCE ABOUT THE NATURE OF SENSATION, PERCEPTION, FORMATIONS, AND SPIRITS, WE CALL IT "AVIDYA." Ever since I've been a realtor, I've never seen anything like this. I've only heard of these things, but I never thought I'd experience it first-hand. The tenant has returned to their country. I've emailed the pictures to them, but they haven't replied. You could sue for damages, but it probably won't be worth the time and cost of the lawyer. It'd be better if you fix it up yourself. I don't have the means to. The rent of the condo pays the mortgage. Then why don't you fix it up a bit and move in yourself? My client, who was interested in your house's location, is still looking for a house. I think I can get you 70,000 to 80,000 per month. But I've talked to Kwin about this. He won't agree with it. That house belongs to Kwin. ING'S HOUSE Mom, can I have three eggs? I want to be so tall that I can reach the stars. How can you be that tall? You must have watched too many cartoons. Eat up all your veggies and I'll let you eat in front of the television. Ing, lower the television volume, honey. Kwin, I'm going to let Tom show the house to a potential tenant. We've already talked about this. I won't put our house up for rent. We have a lot of stuff. We can't move all of this into your condo. But we could get up to 70,000 a month for the rent. And just let a random person live in our house? If the tenant is troublesome, then it's not worth the money. But Tom told me their background is good. They are a family of doctors. Wasn't the previous tenant a teacher? That's why... I want you to help screen them. I think you should just sell the condo. It's better than foreclosure by the bank. I don't want to sell it. If I sell it now, it will be at a loss. It'd be like pouring my efforts down the drain after renting it out all these years. I'm asking you just one more time. At least meet with them first. If you don't like them, we won't rent the house out. And I won't ever speak about this again. Okay? Ms. Arpakorn, please come in for your interview. May I have your resume, please? EXPECT SALARY: 45,000 BAHT Hello? Kwin, I'm still waiting for my interview. Could you please take care of the tenant for me? - I'm afraid I won't make it in time. - Actually, Ning, I don't want torent the house out to anyone. If you can't make it, should we just cancel them? No. We can't cancel them now. Please. I'll be there soon. Hurry home then. Perhaps this book might be of help to you. If I'm able to move into this house, we will probably have a chance to talk more. Ms. Ning. You've returned. Yes. This is Dr. Nuch. Hello. This is Ms. Ratree, Dr. Nuch's mom. She has just retired from working at the hospital so she'd like to find a rental house and live with Dr. Nuch here in Bangkok. It's quiet and peaceful here. Who would've thought it's in the middle of the city? So when can we start renting? Well... Next month is fine. That's great. Let's look at the rental contract, shall we? - Sure. - Good. Here you are. Ning! Are you leaving already? Yes, Aunty Phorn. The ficus tree you asked for, I'll text you to come get it later then. Thank you, Aunty Phorn. If the tenant causes any problems, you can always give me a call. Come visit when you have time. I will. - Good luck, honey. - Thank you. Go. - Ing! - Yes, Aunty Phorn. - Good luck, Ing. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. ING'S HOUSE Are you ready? I'm ready. If we're ready, let's go! That's my girl! Here, I have a present for you, Ing. Open it. Let's see if you like it. Why? Don't you like it? This is Ms. Bunny and her kitchen. You told me you wanted it. Well? I already told you I wanted the Guri Doll, like this one. With purple hair, but wearing a blue princess dress. They don't sell Guri Dolls anymore, honey. So I don't know where to get one for you. Did she just fall asleep? Yes, she has been having trouble falling asleep. She's still not used to it, I guess. Is that the book Ms. Ratree gave you? No, it's a factory's mechanical manual. That's some weird book, so I threw it away. Tonight's hot. Do you want to sleep inside together? I'm already used to it. I also snore loudly. It will wake Ing up. Thank you for moving into the condo with me. Living here is good. It's also closer to Ing's school. She won't have to wake up so early. You love her so much. Should we have another? Ning. Ning. Hey. When did you get a tattoo? Well, the other night I went to Khaosan with my boss. We were drunk and daring each other. They said this tattoo was the least painful. Hello, miss. - I'm Ing's mom. - Hi. You gave her homework to do the family tree, right? Yes, that's right. All right. And it's due tomorrow? - Right. - Okay. All right. Right. Hello, Dr. Nuch. How are... What are you doing here? Well, I'd like to get something from the storage room. - Ing needs our family pictures for her... - Sure. Please come in. Thank you. Come on. Okay. Ms. Ning? Sorry. No worries. Here. Dr. Nuch, the move was so sudden. - I'm not sure if there is any mail... - There is. Let me go fetch it for you. Thank you. AUNTY PHORN: DROP BY MY PLACE BEFORE YOU LEAVE - Here you go. - Thank you. Sorry about that. I thought they were mine, so I opened them. It's fine. Did they see you come over? Do you mean Dr. Nuch? They don't seem to be like doctors. They shut themselves in the house all day. I've never seen them go out anywhere, ever. Come take a look. Do you see the crow's feathers over there? It looks like some kind of black magic. Every day at 4:00 a.m., I always hear them chanting something, coming out from Ing's old bedroom. There was one night, Baitoey, my doggie, was howling nonstop. So I got up to take a look. I saw a flock of crows flying over your house. There were tons of them. In the morning, I found Baitoey... dead behind the house. It was covered all over in blood. Aunty Phorn. REGISTERED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER SEARCH THE MEDICAL COUNCIL OF THAILAND FIRST NAME: RATREE LAST NAME: KHEMARAK SORRY, WE COULDN'T FIND ANY MATCHING RESULTS "RATREE KHEMARAK" IN OUR DATABASE. Oh, no. Kwin. Why are you looking up Ms. Ratree's name? I want to know if she's really a doctor or not. But I can't find her name in the database. She's already retired. Her name might have fallen off the list. Is there something? I think they are kind of strange. I dropped by to get something at the house today. Dr. Nuch didn't seem to want me to enter the house. And look, they opened our mail as well. I'll take care of changing our mailing address as soon as possible. Kwin. The tattoo you got, what's that symbol, by the way? I don't know either. I just thought it looked nice. Did you know Dr. Nuch also has the same tattoo as yours? The same one? I didn't think it'd be so generic. NUT NUT Hello. Hello? Hello, Ning. What's up? Mom, look at this. Hello? Nut, I have a favor to ask. Could you help do a background check on my tenant? Why? Did they do something wrong? It seems like they're a part of some kind of cult. Did they do anything illegal? Mom, there's someone in the room. Who is it, Ing? It's just a reflection in the mirror. Go back to sleep, okay? It's not morning yet. AUNTY PHORN SENT A VIDEO AUNTY PHORN: THEY'RE DOING THAT RITUAL AGAIN - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra DID THEY CATCH YOU RECORDING? ARE YOU OKAY? Kwin. Kwin. Kwin. Kwin. Who's there? Kwin! Why didn't you answer? Where did you go? I found a rat in the bathroom, so I caught it and released it downstairs. If you went to release the rat, why did you bring that book with you? I used it to cover the can I caught the rat in. It's dirty. Throw it away. Why are you keeping it? Yes. I'm going to bed then. I have to take Ing to school early tomorrow. Okay. AUNTY PHORN UNSENT A MESSAGE WHY DID YOU DELETE THE CLIP? Hello, Ms. Ning. Are you here to visit Aunty Phorn? She's not here. I heard she went back to her hometown. Aunty Phorn is from Bangkok and she doesn't have any relatives elsewhere. Well, I don't know. That's what she said. When she comes back, I'll let her know you came to visit her. Ing, I told you to put your things away when you come home. It's already 5:30 p.m. Your iPad time is over. Don't cry. Ing, I've got a headache. Let's order something to eat, okay? Ing, help Mom bury it, okay? Will it not wake up anymore? - Ing? - It's already dead. Close the lid and put it into the hole. Dad prepared it for you. Ing. You did well, honey. Let Ms. Bunny go to sleep... Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Mom, that's my doll! Where did you get it from, honey? Dad gave it to me for my birthday. No. I'm not going. No. I don't want to. No. - I don't want to. - Are you having a nightmare, honey? WEDNESDAY, 21ST SEPTEMBER Does it hurt? No. THURSDAY, 22ND SEPTEMBER THURSDAY, 22ND SEPTEMBER "One, one, three." Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye Wo-You... - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye Wo-You... Pu-Na! Ning. Mom. Can I have boiled eggs today? I'm tired of fried eggs. Mom. Can I have sausages too? Of course. Let me use the bathroom real quick, okay? Ning! Did you take anything from my bag? What are you talking about? Ing, did you open my bag? I told you, right? Don't mess with my work bag. I didn't do anything. I didn't open it. Ing? Ing. Ing. - Ing! - Mom. - I'm here. - Ing. Are you hurt, honey? Where did she go? That granny, where did she go? What granny? The one who's renting our house. Wasn't she with you just now? I just came down, Mom. Did she do this to you? Where is she, Ing? Where's that hag? Ing! - Tell me where she is! - Ma'am. Ma'am, please calm down. Please stay calm. Ing, let's eat out. I'll get something real quick. Just wait in the car, okay? Why bring an overnight bag to dinner? Ing, go sit in the car seat right now. - Where are you taking her? - Any place where that freaky cult can't get to her. Ning. Wait. Let's talk first. What do we need to talk about? That hag went to Ing's school today. Are you imagining things? I talked to her, she didn't meet with Ms. Ratree. If it wasn't her, then who would it be? I saw her with my own eyes. Who knows if she did anything to Ing? That's why Ing couldn't remember. - Don't you see the bruise on her neck? - Mother didn't hurt Ing! So you call her Mother now? I'm giving you one last chance. Tell me what she's planning to do with our child. - No one is doing anything to Ing. - How is that possible? Aunty Phorn has also disappeared. Who knows if they already killed her? You can go, but Ing has to stay with me. - No. - Are you crazy? You're the crazy one! You can be crazy all you want but don't drag Ing along. Will Ing need to die before you realize? Calm down, sir. Ning. - Stop it, sir. - Ning! - Sir, calm down. - Don't take her away, Ning! - Please don't take Ing away! - Stop it, sir. - Ning! Let go of me! - That's enough. Ning! CALLING Hello, Ning. Where are you now? Hello? I'm on my way to your house. I should arrive there in half an hour. Kwin is here looking for you and Ing. Did something happen between you two? Mom, don't tell him where I am. Let me get to the hotel first and I'll call you. Ing. I don't want to stay here. I'm going back to see Dad. Ing. We're not going back to Dad. Let's go to Grandma's... No! I won't go to Grandma's! I will go back to help Dad! Help your dad with what? What does Dad want you to do? Ing. You can tell me. I won't be mad at you. You can tell me, honey. Ing. What is it that your dad won't let you tell me? Please tell me, honey! What does your dad want you to help with? Ing! I tried searching for the ID info from the database. I think your tenant is suspicious. It's because the numbers on her ID have been altered. What? Look here. The number eight here is actually a number three that has been written over. As for the number six, it's actually a number five. After I got the real numbers, I searched through the database and found that the name of the person renting your house isn't Ratree Khemarak. But her real name is Napaporn Pongthewa. She doesn't have any criminal records though. So she forged a fake ID to rent my house? That's right. It looks fishy. Were you beaten up? Are you done? I'm Amm. Nut's girlfriend. Hello. All right then. Thank you so much, Nut. If there's anything else, I'll update you then. Okay. Can you stop messing with Nut? - I don't have any feelings towards... - But he does! Ever since the day you called, he has been busy with your business non-stop. We're getting married. You know what you should do, right? - Well... - Don't call Nut anymore. - I'll have him block your number. - Wait... I... Ing. Ing? Ing. Ing. Ing! Did you see the girl in this room? She left with her dad, ma'am... Ing. - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye... - Wo-Ye... - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Ing. Ing. Ing. Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Hello, Ms. Ning. - Tom. When did the tenant move out? Ms. Ratree moved out yesterday. Didn't Mr. Kwin tell you? Do you know where did they move to? They aren't answering their phones. I think you should try checking the hotel again. Maybe... Mr. Kwin just took Ing out for dinner and has returned. Sure. Is it much further before we reach their rental house? It's not that far. I'll try calling Ms. Ratree again. Okay. Hey, Ms. Ning. What's wrong? Hold it, okay? Ms. Ning. Ms. Ning. Hey! Hey! Ma'am! What are you doing? Don't get closer or I'll call the police! You're also a part of their cult, aren't you? What are you talking about? Open the door right now! Your wrist! There's a tattoo just like theirs. This tattoo? How did you know I took Ing to the hotel? The hotel's keycard is on the back of your phone. I've stayed there before. Please open the door, Ms. Ning. Your daughter is missing. Where are you going? Let me go! Where do you think you're going? FOR SALE OR RENT, RIVERSIDE HOUSE ALARM 11 YEARS AGO Dad. Wake up, Dad. I'm sleepy. - Let's open it together. Come on. - I'm sleepy. Aren't you going to wake up? Take that. Wake up. Come on. Wake up. You can open it up yourself, sweetie. All right, let's open it together. Come here. Let's see. Is it the one you wanted? Go ahead. Happy birthday, sweetie! - Let's open the box. What do you think? - Yes. - Do you like it? - It's so cute. - Do you like it? - I do. You know, I ordered them to make the dress just like the one you have. And your name, Jaa, I stitched it with my own two hands. I'll take extra care of it. She'll be with me for another 500 years! Five hundred years? Too bad I don't have a sister, or else, I'd keep it for her to play with. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Hey! Can it record your voice? Where do you press it? Dad, you're a dinosaur. I won't tell you. A dinosaur? Is this where you press? - Maybe this is where you press? - No, don't tease me like that. It's done. Dad! Can I have three eggs? I want to be so tall that I can reach the stars. You're going to perform on stage, did you take a shower yet? No, it's cold. There's still time, sweetie. Last night, I already fixed the water heater. Do you know how to fix it? That's insulting. I have an engineering degree. You should have told me. I'll go take a shower then. Sure. Don't get your hair wet. JARIYA KANTHAIN Where's the kid's mom? She won't come. She left them after giving birth. Kwin lived with his daughter, just the two of them. - Twinkle, twinkle, little star - Twinkle, twinkle, little star Spread your arms out, Dad. - How I wonder what you are - How I wonder what you are That's not right! Stand straight. What you are I sucked at dancing, right? Look here, sweetie. See what I found? I'll put it on for you. Why don't you eat? Did I make it too crispy? If you don't like it, that's fine. I'll make you some fried chicken instead, okay? Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. Thank you. I love you the most, Dad. JARIYA KANTHAIN DATE OF BIRTH: 21ST NOVEMBER, 2004 DATE OF DEATH: 7TH AUGUST, 2011 Hello, is Ms. Phornchanok here? There's no one here by that name. But my boss told me Aunty Phorn already moved into house number 85... I'm sorry. I got the wrong house. Didn't you see it? Well, I'm truly sorry. - I really didn't see it. - I meant... there. Gosh! Darn it. Here. Thank you. Excuse me. Do you already have insurance? Did I get the steps right, Jaa? Ing, who are you talking to? I'm talking to Ms. Bunny. Well... Finish getting dressed, honey. Then go down to eat. Okay. Mom. - Yes? - Can I have three eggs? I want to be so tall that I can reach the stars. How can you be that tall? You must have watched too many cartoons. Eat up all your veggies and I'll let you eat in front of the television. Ing, lower the television volume, honey. Hello? Kwin, I'm still waiting for my interview. Could you please take care of the tenant for me? I'm afraid I won't make it in time. Actually, Ning, I don't want to rent the house out to anyone. If you can't make it, should we just cancel them? No. We can't cancel them now. Please. I'll be there soon. Hurry home then. Here's the kid's bedroom. This is the master bedroom. Come in. There's a bathroom inside. You can see the pond from the balcony. That's great. Is everything okay? Everything happened so fast. At least she wasn't in any pain. Who are you talking about? You should know better than me. She left before her time. Her spirit is still lingering around where she passed. Perhaps this book might be of help to you. If I'm able to move into this house, we will probably have a chance to talk more. Ms. Ning. You've returned. This is Dr. Nuch. Hello. This is Ms. Ratree, Dr. Nuch's mom. She has just retired from working at the hospital, so she'd like to find a rental house and live with Dr. Nuch here in Bangkok. It's quiet and peaceful here. Who would've thought it's in the middle of the city? So... when can we start renting? Next month is fine. On that day we first met, it's as if you can see my daughter's spirit. Ing also seems to notice that Jaa is still around, but why... Why can't I ever see her? If you have faith in His Mightiness, He will hear your prayers, son. It depends on... whether you open your heart to His Mightiness or not. ALARM Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Here's your mail. - Thank you. Wait a moment. Mother is traveling clairvoyance. Ms. Ning? Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye... The crows you see are the messengers from His Mightiness. He came to say that it's time for Jaa's spirit to depart. Why? I... I haven't even met Jaa yet. She doesn't want to leave you, but she has no choice. Ms. Ratree, do you have a way to help Jaa? Ms. Ratree. I'm begging you. Please help me and my daughter. I haven't even met her yet. I beg of you. I want to meet her, Ms. Ratree. Mother Ratree, please help me and my daughter. Please, Mother Ratree. I want to meet Jaa at least once more. Mother, please help me. I'm earnestly begging you, Mother. Please help me. I don't have... Son. I can perform a ritual to bring Jaa's spirit back. But firstly, we have to find a new body for her. Body? Yes. The body needs to be around the same age as Jaa and is able to communicate with spirits. Do you mean Ing? Two spirits can live together in one body. Jaa will just be a resident. Will it put Ing in any danger? She won't feel any kind of change. A Guri Doll. Is it the one you wanted? Here. This doll... used to belong to Jaa, honey. Jaa is your older sister, Ing. She's also my daughter. How long have you been seeing Jaa? You've never told me about her. She doesn't like it. She disappears every time someone else is around. But... I haven't seen her since we moved to the condo. Granny Ratree told me that Jaa won't be with us anymore. Jaa doesn't have a body like us, honey. That's why she can't continue to be with us. Ing, do you want Jaa to come back? Granny Ratree told me that you can help her. You're the only one who can help her, honey. Dad, don't cry. I'll be the one to help Jaa. Thank you, honey. Kwin, I'm taking Ing to school now. We're going to be together again, sweetie. Jaa, return to me soon. I want to hug you so much. Okay, sweetie? Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Jaa? Jaa, it's you, right? It's me, your dad. Jaa! Jaa, show yourself to me, please. NING SAW ME PERFORM THE RITUAL Ning. DR. NUCH TOMORROW, MOTHER WILL PERFORM THE RITUAL FOR JAA AND ING Before the ritual, we need marks in three different areas on Ing's body. Jaa has already made the first mark. If Ing permits me today, I will make the second one. What about the third one? You will have to be the one to create it. Since you're the one who created her. Ing is here. No need to worry. Mother has done this ritual successfully before. Ning! Please don't take Ing away! Ning! - How I wonder what you are - How I wonder what you are That's not right! Stand straight... Dad! It's me, Ing. Come get me. Ing? Where are you, honey? Watch where you're going! I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. So... Are you done? Dad, you came so late. Mom is coming, honey. We have to leave now. DR. NUCH: COME OVER TO AUNTY PHORN'S HOUSE Tom, can you take me to meet Ms. Ratree, please? - What happened? - I'll tell you about it. Tom found me a new house far from here. When Ning gets there and find that it's empty, she'll probably go look elsewhere. I don't think she'll come back here tonight. You said Aunty Phorn went to meditation training, when will she return? I have something to talk to her about. Aunty Phorn will return tonight. Don't you believe me? I do. Let's go and prepare for the ritual at your house. It's time to create the last mark. Ing. Go wait on the bed, honey. Close your eyes as well. Jaa? That's you, right? Jaa. Aunty Phorn. You know, I thought something had happened to you. I thought you... Dad! Dad. - Dad. - Run. - Dad! - Come here. - Let me go. - Be quiet. Dad! This is Prae, my youngest daughter. She drowned when she was seven. Jaa? Jaa, it's you, right? Jaa. I've kept Prae's spirit in this doll for decades waiting for a suitable body. Dad! Tonight, she will come back to life once again. ALARM 4 MONTHS AGO Ing is the girl sitting next to the pink bag, Mother. Mother. Does she really have a sixth sense just like what Tom said? Hello, Ms. Ning. Your tenant has already moved out. Yes, they said their contract with the school ended. So they moved back to their country. Sure. When would you like to go check the room? Okay, Ms. Ning. Mother, she'll come to check the room next week. We've arrived at that child's house, Prae. Will this girl's spirit cause us trouble, Mother? Not at all. She'll be useful to us. Little one. Come out to Granny. Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Stay in this doll, okay? Kwin is willing to do anything to bring his girl back. Granny Ratree told me that you can help her. You're the only one who can help her, honey. ALARM - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra Mom.

Can Jaa really live in my body? Of course. Because in my body, there is also another person. See? When I was 18, I allowed this girl to live with me. Where is she now? Hello. My name is Ratree. What we're doing right now is traveling clairvoyance. You've had this talent since you were born. That's why you can see Jaa. I've been living in Napaporn's body for decades. But my spirit doesn't age with the body. How did you get into this body? - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra This is when I did the ritual 50 years ago. - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra - Wo-Ye Wo-You Pu-Na Cha-Ra My great-grandpa descended from the leader of His Mightiness from around the Himalayas. If I do the ritual, then Jaa will be with me forever, right? Yes. But you have to give permission first. I give permission. I'll be back, honey. Granny, why did you let Ratree live in your body? Are you two best friends? No, we hardly knew each other. Actually, the owner of this body was murdered, so I could live in it alone. Is it you, Ratree? Dad. - Dad! - Come here. - Dad. - Be quiet! No! ALARM SATURDAY, 24TH SEPTEMBER Let me go! Let me go! Come out, Ms. Ning. Without a car, you can't go back to help your daughter. Nuch, go check if Phorn is done. Yes, Mother. If you don't come out now, you won't get to see your child again. The ritual is about to start. TOM NING HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF SHOULD I GO BACK THERE? YES, WE'RE AT KWIN'S HOUSE Be quiet!
