You will remain noble. You will show a strong mind. You will show great character. You will stand against injustice. You will show your strength. Defend yourself. Good. Strike me. Strike me. Now strike me. I'm trying. This is a street fight. Hey. I have work in 40 minutes. I thought um, court didn't start until 8:00. I told you I was going in early today. We have time Is it so crazy I just want to love my wife? You just want to have sex. If you want to love me, I don't know, I mean, get a job, buy me flowers, take out the trash. Just do something. Be here. You know, I would think that you would know how hard it was for me to close the damn restaurant during the pandemic. I put everything I had into that place. You must mean everything we had. We had, okay? You knew the plan was for every meal that we sold was to give one to a homeless family and you were down for that. What happened, huh? You're just mad at me. And what I love is changing the world out here but you're sitting on some throne, looking down on people like we're... we're peasants. When the truth of the matter is, you're just like us. Cut it out, all right? Nobody's mad and I don't look down on anyone. At my job, I look people in their eyes every single day and I let them tell me who they are. Yeah, but when you look at me, what do you see, huh? A man who's very short-sighted. You know, Jaeda, my sight is very well, thank you. Okay. All right. Since you want to engage, let's go ahead and engage, Gerald. There is something missing in this marriage. There are no butterflies in my stomach, my heart doesn't skip a beat when you walk into the room, I got no fucking flutters. And I want that, I deserve it. No flutters? Shit. You wanna know why there's no feelings? It's because of the damn phone. No, no, okay. Don't blame the phone. It's a little something called "work", in case you forgot. Mommy and daddy, can you stop fighting? Oh no, mommy and daddy aren't fighting. We're okay. ♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na ♪ Wonder where you're coming, wonder where you've been ♪ ♪ Did you leave someone so far behind Will you meet again? ♪ ♪ They say life is just a... 94.5 in your morning drive. Today Judge Jaeda King is sentencing the convicted killer Sean Samuels. King has been criticized by ACLU groups for being pro-prosecution. You made a mess. Looks like I did. I got shotgun. Ooh. Oh, wait. Funny. Inappropriate, but... Didn't think you'd be here this early. Sam, are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the bacon in me. You know, I still can't believe she kept this case. Yeah, this is well over her head. And look, it's not like I'm not for more women on the bench, but these BAPS... They're just not ready. What the hell is a BAP? Black American princess. That's racist, Carl. I am just saying, colored women do not have the constitution to make the hard choices. They're too emotional. And colored? This isn't 1952. No. But if America was still America, I could speak whatever I want to say. And I say colored. We gotta go. Morning Jaeda. Mr. Hawkins, you know I'm not a fan of ex parte communication. My apologies, your honor. I won't be long. Well, if you want to speak to me, You know, there are a lot of people counting on you to do the right thing. Mr. Hawkins, you're being inappropriate. No. Telling her what's happening that she can't see. I don't need your help. That's what you said when I quizzed you about Pennoyer versus Neff before civ pro. Then, you got called on and you slayed it. Not because of you, in spite of you. Say what you will. But I'm just being a friend. Are you though? Because a real friend wouldn't be in my chambers violating our basic ethical tenets. Or a real friend would violate a basic ethical tenet - to protect said friend. - Okay, leave my office. No. Not until you talk to me. There isn't anything to talk about, Duke. Yes, there is. There's a lot. Now, I promised I wouldn't bring this up until it was over, It... Okay, what is it? You know what it... Jaeda, I am trying here. And there are two people who know everything about this case. You and me. Secrets that we can't tell anyone else. Not Gerald. Not Cynthia. You know we share a bond. Ever since that first time I saw you sitting in the front row of your One L orientation, - up until the last time that we... - Okay, Duke. Duke, Duke, you can stop now. Let me finish. Fine. You have 30 seconds and then I'm calling a marshal. I only need about 10. Yeah, I approached the bench. I was there when you cried uncontrollably studying for the bar. I was there when you put so much pressure on yourself after your first trial that you ended up in the hospital. I was there when Gerald wasn't. He was a mistake. Look, you go out there and you put an end to the coldest hitman since Jorge Ayala. You and me. Together. And then... let's do what we used to do together. We're not 20 something and in law school anymore. No. We were kids then. We were playing at being grown. We're grown now. We can do what grown folk do. Oh, 32 seconds. Time's up. Cut the... You know, this desk looks pretty sturdy. Two grown folk could take that for a test. Ah. Unbelievable. Out. Now. Okay. See you in court, your honor. Oh my gosh. Need to see your IDs please. I actually left it at the last job. How about you Dana? You got yours? Sure don't. In my purse. Which I don't need when you're driving. Sorry, boss. But by the time we head back across town and come back, we could have this back to normal. You know they need to be ID'd before we can let 'em in. And then what? You know the judge wants this fixed. You heard what she said. And what is she going to say when she hears we let them loose? Shit. My point exactly. We open in about an hour and 20. You think you can have it fixed by then? What's that? 8:00? What do you think, Dana? I think we can have everything in tiptop shape by 7:58. There you go. All right fine. Thank you. What's going on, Jerry? Yeah, what's going on? You look crazy and shit. I look crazy? Yeah. I'd think you were the one getting sentenced. Yeah, stepping into my client's shoes and all. I just forgot to plug my phone in last night, forgot my charger. I got three cases right after this, so, you know, I'm fucked. - That's it? - Yeah, that's it. Nothing to it, right? I guess not. It's your lucky day. Wow. You are a mensch. You're a mensch. Thank you. Make sure I get that back. I promise. Hey, where's the judge? I can't believe she's got us waiting here an hour and she hasn't even showed up. Hey, of course she'll be here. Do yourself a favor. Go to the bathroom and wash yourself up. You look like a disaster. I look bad? Is that right? Huh? Something has changed. There was a time that you would make sure that someone was fighting for the little man. I literally go to work and I have to look at evil straight in the eye every single day. And I am the one voice that speaks for thousands. Everybody's ready. I also brought in the four other inmates, so we can handle their cases as soon as we're done with this piece of shit. Judge? Oh... What's going on, Judge? I was thinking, maybe I should reassign this case. Reassign? Why? To who? To anyone. I mean, I... I don't need this. I really don't. How long have we been together, Judge? I don't know. You know, I don't know, John. Maybe this is just too much. Too much? No. Not for you. When they first assigned me to your chambers, Judge, I thought, why in the hell would they assign me to you? Okay. Excuse me? Hear me out. I've been here forever. O.G. Not you. You were the youngest appointed to the bench. In the state. Came from that cushy job at that big law firm. Fancy law school. Nothing, I mean nothing, that said you were built for this. Okay. But boy, was I wrong. 'Cause then I got to know you. And I saw how hard you work. Endlessly. And how seriously you take every order that you write. You ignored the threats, cut through the noise, and here you are. Judge, do not let weak, anonymous people make you doubt who you are. You're Jaeda fucking King! Who better to handle this than you? Each of you have been a loyal employee of this company. Being the founder and CEO, I would say you're the best of the best. But you all have one more thing in common. You all have suffered injustice directly or indirectly. In short, because of your dedication and heart, you are the ones that I've chosen to accompany me on this journey. A journey greater than any mind can fathom. If anyone wants to leave now, please return to your office. No negative action will come to you. But if you remain, we will make history together. All rise for Judge King. All rise for Judge King. Comes now the matter of the United States of America versus Sean Samuels. For the record, I want to ensure that the courtroom is closed to the public for safety purposes. The only people that should be in this courtroom are those with business before the court. Victim family representatives and law enforcement. Before the court imposes sentence, I would like to call on both attorneys. Is there anything you wish to state to the court this morning? Nothing for the government, Your Honor. Not for the defense, Your Honor. Mr. Samuels, would you please stand? You have the right to address the court this morning before imposition of sentence. If there's anything you'd like to say, now's the time. Now, you are not required to say anything, if that be your choice. Is there anything with which you wish to state to the court this morning? Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. You listen to the people that took that stand. They lied to you and that jury. But clearly, the jury finds it easier to think that a black man would kill before a white man would lie. I hope that you can look at me and see the truth. And that... that I deserve to live. I don't deserve to die here. Sir, you were afforded a fair trial. I made sure of that. And you were found not guilty on Counts 2, 5, 6, and 7. So, you are now discharged of those counts. However, you were found guilty, pursuant to a jury's verdict on Counts 1, 3, and 8 for first degree murder. You having been found guilty, I am judging you guilty on those counts. Yeah, I'll be able to make it. Plus, a few hours OT. Just tell Andre to hold tight to her pa... pa... Signals blocked. Hello? Hello? Signal here is horrible. Shit! This thing is down, too. Damn modern technology. I'm going to go over there and sit down and read the newspaper. Having adjudged you guilty, I am now imposing the following sentence. This a closed door session this morning. We need to ask you to leave. No, we're going in. Going in now. The question is, will you be breathing or not when we do? Do you realize where you are? It's a courthouse. I will have dispatch in my ear. Phase one. We enter the courthouse at 7:00 a.m. One hour before it opens to the public. By the time people realize something's off, we'll be gone. Guards at the front are retirees. Generally, they won't fight, but if they do, we do what we have to. How do we get to the business? Our tech specialist, Alex and Alicia, will disable the plumbing the afternoon before and secure access. We know their contractor. We know their after-hours tech. Alex and Alicia will become that contractor. How do we wake up at home? Be patient, my friend. Absolutely. Crystal clear. So, you need to think very carefully before your next move. For you and your kinfolk. Sorry, fellas. The courthouse is closed. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said the courthouse is closed. What the hell is going on? Come on. Get down. Go, go, go, go. Let's move. Phase two. Come on, come on. Get up, get up. Give me your walkie. Come on, come on. Stand up. Come on. Move, move. Let's go. I sentence you to death. To be carried out by lethal injection. Everybody, down! Down! Down or you're dead! Holy shit! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Move, move. Move, come on. Let's go. Don't move. Calm down! Hello, Judge. This is Gabriel Samuels. The brother of Sean Samuels. The same man you just sentenced to death despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence. Now, before I say much more, it would go a long way in resolving our differences if I know my brother's behind that door. Don't say shit. Fuck you, man. - What is... What is there for me to say? - One fucking word, I will kill you. - John, take it easy, all right? - Shut the fuck up, Jerry. No, come on. - Nothing. - Shut the fuck up, Jerry. This shit ain't random. What is going on? All my calls are monitored and my visits. You tell me what's going on. Ain't you the law? He didn't do nothing, John. Shut the fuck up, Jerry! I didn't do nothing. I'm on this side of the door. Ask them what's going on. 25 minutes. Bring me the old one. I don't want any trouble. You think what you want has any bearing on what happens to you today, Judge Smith? How do you know me? How could you forget me is the question? Judge King, I need you and my brother to come through that door. Now, I have your friend Judge Smith here with me. If you choose not to do so, then I'm afraid he'll be retiring today. Yeah, it... it's me, Miss King. Please, please help me. It's Judge, not Miss. You're right. I'm sorry, Judge. But please, please just help me. Sorry, Carl. Not gonna be able to help you today. Not coming out. Neither is his brother. Oh, that's unfortunate. Judge, my brother is your only leverage. I think we should know he's really in there with you. Let's hear it. Hey, brother. Hey, brother. Boy, you caused quite the commotion today. I'm sorry I didn't do it before they sentenced you. It's all good, I'm good. I told you to let whatever happened just happen. Yeah, well, we see what happened. So, what you want to do now? Now we get you out of here. You know, something's telling me that they're not just gonna Yeah, I don't think they can stop us, baby bro. I know how we can stop 'em. Come on, John. Send him. No fucking way, Jerry. We open that door, they kill us. You have one minute, Judge, or we're coming in. Sorry, Gabriel. But your brother has been committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, and we will make sure they retain jurisdiction. Thank you very much, but no thanks. As predicted. You hear that, Judge? Now, how are you gonna explain this to his family? Phase three. Coward under the desk. Get him up. Bring him here. Get your ass from up under there. Fuck you. Get off me. Get off me! Get off me. Get the fuck off me! Get off! Duke Hawkins. Big bad prosecutor hiding under the desk. You are fucking with the wrong guy. I cannot wait to put you and your brother on death row. Ooh, "You're fucking with the wrong guy." I guess, you're not so tough, deep down, are you? Fuck around. Then, find out. Let him go. You know, my mom, God bless her soul, she would take us to church every Sunday. There's this story about Jesus stopping a mob from killing a woman. He said to them, "Let those without sin cast the first stone." You know what happened? They went home. Let her live. I don't need a Sunday school sermon from you. You know, those who really need it are the first to say they don't. What? Listen carefully. Things are gonna get very interesting for you. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Get up. Get up. Breathe, breathe. I need you to record everything that's said. It'll become the gospel. And you may get very rich. Because you are transcribing the Parable in the Court of Black Caesar. Come on, guys, I got veal scallopini waiting at home for me, and I hate cold fucking scallopini. Come on! We need to go! I think I'd rather wait on my brother. Now, you're coming whether you like it or not, criminal. Mr. Samuels, I don't blame you. Okay, I know what just happened in court. But I promise you this, if you come with us and we make it out of here alive, I will order a full review into your case. You could have did that already. Okay, yes, maybe I could have. You're getting this, right, Counselor? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm getting it. Can we fucking please go? They left as... As anticipated. Cut them off. This feels powerful. This feels powerful. The People versus Duke Hawkins shall convene. Go ahead and take the stand, Mr. Hawkins. You're crazy as hell if you think I'm going up there. Now, you could either take that seat on your own power or mine, but you will have that chair. Let's get everybody in place. Let's go. Get over there. Give me the gun. Come on. Let's go. Keep it moving. Come on, keep it moving. Kneel down. What you gonna do? Put me in the front? I ain't even got no gun. Motherfucker, you're the one. They ain't gonna hit you. Go. Fuck. Come on. Come on, get in.á ♪ Fuck! The seven of you will hear evidence. Four of you who love Mr. Hawkins and three of you who love him less, so. You are gonna question this man. I've taken the liberty of providing you an envelope of evidence we were able to pull off of Mr. Hawkins and Judge King's electronic devices. As well as an outline of an examination. And Duke, for every proven lie you tell, one of your colleagues up there dies. What's your name? Anthony. What's your level of education, Anthony? I did some college. I can read if that's what you're asking. Very good. Continue. Salima. 10 minutes till Phase four. Continue, counselor. Raise your hand, motherfucker. You swear to tell the truth with your bitch ass? We're not gonna have a chance if we don't get to the ammo. We have to get to the safe. I'll get you out of here. I know you will. This what you supposed to be saving us with? This skinny-ass gun safe? Y'all must not know shit about my brother. He owns the biggest cyber security firm on the East Coast. Y'all don't even know his nickname? Your brother? Are you gonna ask me my wife's nickname? Huh? Listen, they call him "Black Caesar". - Yeah? - My wife's name is Marge. - She ain't got no nickname. - Wait a minute. Is that why you killed all those people? - To protect your brother? - Oh my God. For the 88th time, I didn't kill nobody. - Ah. - Mm-hmm. Says everyone who's ever been popped. My wife is mean. That's why she ain't got no nickname. That's it! Mean Marge. She's gonna kick my ass for being late. Mean fucking Marge. - Bitch. - Oh my... oh my God. Listen. Say what you want, but I made the decision to come with y'all. These bullets ain't got no name on 'em. So why would your brother risk hurting you? What are y'all on? Haven't y'all realized that this is bigger than me? Back hallway. Hello? Scallopini, come on! Let's get the fuck out of here. What about my gun? State your name for the record. You. Fuck you. You should say objection. Non-responsive. Objection. Non-responsive. Sustained. Why did you do that? I didn't do anything. You should think very carefully before every response you make. Send me Sean, and I may spare everyone else. Umm, maybe we should just... Shut up, Jerry. We've already had this discussion. Sean, your brother's waiting and we got a way out. Come with me and they won't shoot you. I won't let 'em. Salima, I tried, but this fucking cop guy said he's gonna kill me. And I kind of believe him. Is that right? Right after I kill you, bitch. Fine. You should duck, Sean. I got you. Just fucking shoot. Yeah. Got it. Got it, man. Hey, get the fuck off. You're welcome. God, I can't take much more of this. Come on. Hey, with me, convict. Stay close. All right, let's speed things up. State your name for the record. Please. Duke Hawkins. Tell us about the relationship with Judge King. We went to law school together. We graduated together. We interned at the same law firm together. - You in... - Wait! You're not finished yet, are you, Mr. Hawkins? No. We had a relationship off and on during this trial. Were you dating? No. Yet you continue to pursue her, even though you're both married? Yes. Louder, so the court reporter can hear you. Yes! So, two former lovers keeping a relationship from the public during a murder trial. That would be a conflict of interest, would it not? Yes, it would. And that, is prosecutorial misconduct. Let's go. -What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? What? What? Open that shit. I'm not touching that shit. You fucked up the trial. What do you think about that, Judge? Huh? Huh? - You fucked it up. - What? - Yeah. - I fuck... No. What I think is I want to go home and see my family. And if that means giving him another hearing, then I'm gonna do that, okay? The trial was a trial. Trial was the trial. You nearly ruled against every objection I made. I ruled on the evidence, Jerry. Bullshit. You wouldn't allow me to cross-examine the witnesses. You didn't let the prosecution give me those boxes of evidence. You would do anything in your power to stack the deck. I did not stack the deck. How dare you? You know, what I did is my fucking job. So, why don't you try doing yours? Defend your client. Don't get mad at me. Hey, hey! Alright? I don't know who put you on this bench, but you suck. - You suck. - I suck? - Yeah. - You know what? That's real easy for you to say, because you're not the one who has to live with making a mistake. You're not the one who has to make the mistake of putting a criminal back on the street. Making a mistake that could kill a little kid. Making a mistake that keeps you up night after night. You are not the one, Jerry. So, you know what? If I make it just a little bit harder for someone to go free on some technicality, then so be it. - Yeah? - What about Sean? Somebody that didn't do anything. So, be it. Let's go. You interviewed an inmate who testified against the defendant in this case, didn't you? Yes, I did. And that inmate testified that the defendant admitted to killing the victims in this case. Yes. And he also testified that no promises were made, correct? Yes. But that wasn't true. It was true. Why are you doing this? Just take your brother and leave. No, I don't know what rule of evidence that question falls under, but you should answer. I mean, there were no promises made. Show him exhibit one. Read the highlighted part. Out loud. Thanks for... Out loud! Thanks for agreeing to dismiss the extra charges, so I could see my kids. I only will testify once I'm assured that will happen. And he testified, didn't he? Yes. So you allowed him to lie to the jury and you lied again. Wait. No, wait! Do not lie again. Two minutes. The firewalls are pushing me out. We need the keys. What, you deaf now? I said we need the keys. Let's go. Come on. You motherfuckers. Help. Pussy. Hello, Detectives, Chiefs, Officers, FBI, or any other law enforcement agent that may find themselves within earshot of this message. Right now, myself and my associates are holding several individuals hostage in the federal courthouse. I know your first question is, who am I? I will not answer that. Your second question is, what do I want? I will get what I came for and I will walk out alive. And I know you're gathering resources and trying to come up with the best place to breach the courthouse. I would caution against that. Any attempts at a breach will result in the death of hostages. It will result in the death of hostages. Inside the envelope, you'll find an account for an offshore bank account. Please deposit 4 million US dollars by 9:00 a.m., or yes, you guessed it. It will result in the death of hostages. Proceed at your own risk. What the fuck is this? Oh, shit. Motherfucker. It's like they fucking know where we're going before we even get there. Yeah, maybe it's a small building. It's not that fucking small, Jerry. Something's going on. Something like what, John? I don't fucking know yet. I thought you had all the answers. We have to go. Hey, did that really happen to you? Did what happen? Did you let someone go and they killed someone? I uh, you know, believe it or not, when I first got on the bench, I felt it was my duty to hold the government to a higher standard. That all the evidence had to be pristine. You know, growing up in Memphis, I saw my cousins and friends get railroaded by police and judges. So, I wanted to defend them. So when I got on the bench, I thought, this is it. This is where I'm supposed to be. To do good. Do justice. And there was this guy who was charged with killing someone in a DUI. Black guy. Good job. No criminal history. Great family. The officers failed to control the blood sample, so, I tossed it. Without that, they had to let him go. A week later, I open the paper and I see his face. Next to a kid. A teenager. The same man that I let go killed someone a week later. I was wrong. I was wrong. So I promised myself, never again. Never again. Not on my watch. But you are. You wrong about me, too. No, no. Was it? Witness identification. You didn't even let my lawyer cross-examine the officer who did the lineup. You didn't take the stand. They told me not to. They told me that the prosecution would tear me apart and I didn't have a chance. It was your right. It was my right to live my fucking life. That's my right. Come on, Judge. It's my life. Look, just look at me. Look at me. Tell me the truth. Did you murder those people? No, Your Honor. I didn't kill nobody. I didn't. I didn't kill nobody. I didn't kill nobody. Okay, so, why wouldn't your brother just try to stop the transfer? Why go through all of this? You kept evidence from the defense, didn't you? Yes. Evidence that could suggest Sean Samuel's innocence, huh? Yes. None of the witnesses could pick the defendant out of the lineup, could they? Yes. Yes. You argued that the defendant's DNA could be found at several murder scenes, correct? But what you didn't tell the jury is that the initial test came back negative and inconclusive. No, I didn't. And the samples only came back positive, because the defendant's sample was compromised. I didn't know that. Oh, did you read the report carefully or just the conclusion? The conclusion. Did the judge know about this? No. Yes. Yes. Some. Not all. Why did you do that? Because I knew he did it! It's in his blood. Like father, like sons. Did you just mention my father? You knew the rules and you lied. Your lies cause people to die. See, you cover your lies in the flag. The same fucking flag that's covered in the blood of my people. Now you mention my father again, I'll shove this stick down your fucking throat. When we were 6 and 8, our father was convicted of a murder that he didn't commit. How do you know that he didn't do it? Because he was at home with us, reading us a story. My mom was a nurse, so she worked late. So, whenever just someone was being killed, he was educating his boys. But the judge wouldn't even let us testify. He even threatened to split us up, take us away from our mom. And guess who the judge was? How could you forget me is the question? Your good buddy, Carl Smith. I miss him. He was just like a gentle, lovable guy. He never even had a fist fight, you know? So, when he got locked up, he just... He just couldn't take it. Took his own life. And it crushed my mom. It crushed me. But honestly, I really think Gabriel took it the hardest. So, if I had to guess, I would say maybe he just don't want to see me go through this. Or nobody for that matter. You know, like his own little innocence project. Damn. Consider this early release. Thank you. I gave you my word that I'd help you get out of here. So, you gotta give me your word that you're gonna judge me for me. Hey, Jerry. I thought you don't do murder cases anymore. Yeah, it's a lot less stress. I just... A friend asked me for help on this. A friend? Concerned citizen. Concerned about this piece of shit? Yeah, yeah. You're all sweaty and shit. I don't know, but I think you're the one getting sentenced. Hey. Back hallway. They'll expect us in the front, okay? Hey, Jerry. Why don't you tell me what you think is happening? Smart sons of bitches, that's all I can say, you know. Yeah. Not that smart. They try to fuck with Jaeda, I'm gonna kill 'em. You motherfucker. Who's the pussy now, huh? Huh, tough guy? Yeah. Thanks for the wire. Who... who are you? They call me "King". Jaeda motherfucking King. Let's go. Where you learn that shit? My daddy told me I was a King. And a king better know how to defend their throne. Taught me how to shoot, slice, put me in silat at age 6. Any more questions? 81%. Mr. Duke Hawkins. Any last words before I provide closing argument? I am really sorry for any, any mistake that I made. That's all. Really sorry. Yeah, well, it's time to close this out. Get my men in that building. Walk out alive, my ass. Are you sure? We go. For the record, this is a very bad idea. Well, that's why I'm the Chief. And you're the assistant. Daddy, can we call mommy again? Of course, princess. Looks like we'll... We'll see mommy later, okay? Aw. Don't worry, we'll see her after school. Judge. Hey, Judge. Come on. Judge, come on. Come on, Judge. - Where's Stryker? - He died. - What? - Trying to save us. Yeah. Why do you... Why do you have his gun? He told me to keep it. Protect myself. You survived? He made me leave. - Oh. - He fought them all. - Oh, so... - He saved me! So, you just left him? - What? - You just fucking left him? What do you want me to do? His wife has stage 3 cancer. She is not gonna be okay. We should go. We can make it out. We're so close. No. I'm not leaving. Not yet. - What? - No. There are a lot of people that still need our help. I'm not letting anyone else die! Hey, Judge. Let... Let's cops handle what they're doing over there. All right? The front door is 100 yards away. Freedom is a 100 yards away. The end of all of this crap is a 100 yards away. - He might be right, Judge. - No. Maybe he might be wrong. He is wrong. But you know what? Be my guest. I'm not gonna stand in your way. Okay. I won't. Good luck. - Jerry, you should... - Jerry. Good luck. Coward. Fucking coward. Hey, Sean. Your brother would like to see you. But I'm your client. No. My client who pays my bills. And he would like me to bring him his brother. So, you're selling me out? No, I'm not selling you out. I'm doing it for you. Doing it for you! Should have taken my boss up on his offer. You should have thought twice before you jacked my courtroom. I'm gonna enjoy killing you. Huh? I'm gonna enjoy watching you try. I failed. I tried. You will remain noble. - You will show a strong mind. - I can't even find me. You will show great character. You will show your strength and face any challenging situation. Defend yourself. Now strike. Go. Yeah, feel that? Bitch. I didn't need your help. I didn't do this for you. I ain't never liked that motherfucker. Put him in the chair. It's this way. I know the way. Come on. Let's go. I just saved your ass. - I did that. - Yeah. Yeah, well, your brother just killed my friends. I'm gonna pay him a little visit and I can't ask you to stand by while I do. But you gave me your word. I did. Come on, come on. Did you know that black folks are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times the rate of white folks? One in five black men in prison are serving a life sentence. And our brown brothers and sisters fare no better. Mr. Hawkins. You black man. You hid evidence. You lied. You hid your relationship with the judge. What more do you need to hear to come back with the right verdict? I have no faith in this system. But I have it in you. You get to decide whether the people holding stones should be allowed to throw them and stone us to death for what they accuse us of doing in the light when they do so much worse in the dark. Today, right now, it is in your hands. Thank you. Five minutes to render your verdict. Your honest verdict. We've reached a verdict. Well, come on down here, Mr. Hawkins. Let's face a jury of your peers. We find the defendant... Thank you. Thank you. He went that way. Where are we at? 94. Don't worry. I'ma crack this bitch. Where's my brother, huh? Where's my lieutenant? You mean that bitch with the whack hair. Sorry, but you won't be seeing her anymore. You really are fucked up now. Enough is enough! You continue to be a thorn in my goddamn side. All you had to do was give me my brother. I would have spared you this pain. You continue to be a pawn for a system that's designed to keep people that look like you locked up. I'm not a pawn. Yeah, well, what is it then, Judge? Is it freedom? Or power? You feel strong in that black robe, Judge? What are you willing to die for? The truth. I'm willing to die for the truth. Yeah, well, fuck the truth. No, no, no. Last chance, Judge King. My brother. Okay. He's in the basement. See, that was easy. But too late. Duke, Duke, Duke. You okay, Judge? No. No, I'm not. Where are you going? To finish this. Chief, it's the Governor. What the hell am I watching on TV? No, sir. It wasn't... What happened? It wasn't quite... Done. Come on. Come on! Bingo. Sean! Sean! Sean! - Gabe? - Sean! Gabe! Gabe! - How'd you get out? - Man, the same way we get anywhere. I fought my way out. Let's get you out of here. Oh my God. Okay? I remember the first time we kissed, we laughed about it. You've been my right hand ever since. Never had to rock without you. And I know you'd tell me to stick to the course. Finish the plan. That I must get through. Were you planning this whole thing? Every single detail. But if you wanted to spring me, why not just hit the transport? Like, what's this really about? Look, it's about you. It's about Dad. It's about every black man that's in prison that shouldn't be. Man, I know you too good. Like, tell me what's happening. They've been digitizing and dumping original criminal records for 20 years now. They just finished a purge of documents, which means the only copy is on the electronic filing system. Now, you lose that system, you lose the records. Then you gotta lose the inmates. Or... You pay a king's ransom to the one person in existence that has a backup. - You? - No. You. I'm not taking this, Gabe. - Look, I'm giving you freedom. - No. You stick around here any longer, you risk getting caught. Now, if they believe you had nothing to do with this, then fine. In 10 years, you get released as an old man. In another five years, you sue and settle for a fraction of what you would get for the information on this drive. So, what about you? - Don't worry about me. - Come on. I'll never be too far. I will find you. Look, no matter what you choose, baby bro, I'ma always have your back. Now, let's go. They will come for us. But when they breach, that's our cue for the last phase. In all the chaos of rescuing officers who are injured, they won't look so closely at who's supposed to be there. There's a sealed tunnel that doesn't appear on any modern blueprints. In the chaos, we will move underground. Just like our ancestors. Hey! I wasn't finished. I knew I should have put a bullet in you. You're the one variable I couldn't account for in my plans. It's time to terminate your interference. Bro, let's just go. Yo, why do you keep showing this bitch mercy? I just want you to make it home. She was gonna kill you. It's too late, Judge. I got what I came for. - All of it. - Maybe. But you ain't about to leave with it. Who's gonna stop us? - You? - I'm here. So... I could have killed you. Should have killed you. There's seven of us. Only one of you. What makes you think you're gonna make it out of here alive? Because I'm still here. You ain't finished the job yet. Kill this bitch. Meet us at the next location. What the fuck is that? Oh shit! You bitch! No! No! No, no, no! Where is he? Checkmate. So, he was in on this the whole time? Good job. Thank you, mommy. New start, Monday. New start, Monday. You figure out a name yet? Not yet. I don't know. I just... I want it to be something simple, you know? I'll figure it out. Yeah. - What? - Check me out. - Oh. - Got a new client. - What? - Yep. Doing a tasting tomorrow at 9:00. Okay! Wow. I'm so proud of you, babe. Really. Just how you were able to turn everything around. Yeah, well, I needed a swift kick, you know? Mm. That you did. Yeah. But I'm very, very, very proud of you. You know that? You're a badass. Kinda am. Thank you. Yeah. I'm happy to have you back. Me too. But... I can't rest until I find him. Jaeda... I'm listening to the voice, Gerald. He's still out there. And I know I have to find him. I will find him. ♪ Oh woah, oh woah ♪ Man on a mission ♪ Oh woah, oh woah ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ You know I be on the way ♪ Oh woah, oh woah ♪ Man on a mission, I'ma...
