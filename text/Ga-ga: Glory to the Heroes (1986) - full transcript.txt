GA,GA - GLORY TO HEROES Starring On board of a penitentiary space cruiser. Rags! Disinfected? And how. Smile. Gotta family? We may send it for a keepsake. No. Good for a wall news-sheet. Shitfolks! Short and long-term shitfolks! You are the manure of history, but take it easy. Manure is needed too. The flower of mankind would not bloom without it. And that is why we all make a single, great family. Mankind, that mankind whose laws you have violated, is not rejecting you, riff-raff, but is giving you a merciful chance. Wow! What a great chance it is. Each of you... One by one, will be a pioneer in the expansion of the human family. Each of you will touch with his shit-loaded foot the surfaces of new, unexplored planets. On behalf of the whole community... l know. How you are thinking that many of you will die, freeze to death, perish in fire... Fall prey to alien planetary monsters. But remember this. Yours will be the proud death of conquistadors. And thereby you will propel mankind by a tiny, tiny rung upwards. lf you wonder why l reiterate this so persistently, you should realize that l am doing it with the confidence and hope that you will finally believe it. This is your only chance, shitfolks! And now we shall say good-bye to the one whose lucky turn it is to set out for a trip to mankind lost, a trip to the unknown planet, whitch he shall have the honor to possess for this brothers. Courage. Return contrite! You won't need it now. lt was just a window-dressing. Unless you land on an airless planet. Then you may find it handy. But no one could stand it in this spacesuit for more than a few hours. And you gonna stay there longer much longer, you prick. Drink cosmonaut. After all you are still among people. You deserve it. For your benefit. We are drinking to give you nice memories. Sign here. What is this? The receipt for the spacesuit, instruction booklet, flag and the bill for the farewell reception. l did not get the flag. That flag?! l meant to give it to may kid. The kid would rejoice. He does not care. After arrival at an alien territory, hammer the flag home at a conspicuous spot as the sign of taking the planet into possession for the glory of mankind. Sign! l still need my instructions. Cockroach, you've signed it, so cut the bullshit out. You get in there, you get to alien planet and fix the flag. Then you may collect samples, take snapshots, masturbate or whatever you like. And behave with dignity, like an astronaut should. Remember, that flag is vital. After 29 days, if you survive of course, you will board the shuttle, turn the level and that coffin will take you back to us. Did you understand, cockroach? Well. You are in the shuttle which will take you to an alien planet. While you are traveling , you are a free man, so you have the right of choice. For your psychic comfort l can synthesize the picture and the voice in four variants. Hallo. Hallo. Hallo. Normally, the fourth possibility is the apperance of one of the famous scientists, but since our flight coincides with the anniversary of the discovery of America, l have special offer for you. Hallo. There are four buttons in front of you. Press the one which suits your free choice. Your choice proves you intelligent. But not very original. All guys choose the fourth button. Now you are a free man, and l am a computer. lsn't it magnificent? To be free and not to have to decide on anything? ln case l break down, there is this tiny hammer. You may use it to break the glass and to turn on the breakdown-safe computer. But watch this! Unjustified use is punishable and in that case you will pay for the glass. And now there are only pleasures. We'll take care to keep you relaxed. Die liebe ist schon Mein susser ist gross, lch fuhle mich wahl, Die nacht ist endlos Er, sagt mir im bett. lch lass dich nicht los, Ach Liebchen nain. Ach Scweinchem nain. lch lass dich nicht allein. ln the twenty-first century, mankind became so happy that no one would opt for the tough profession of cosmonaut any more. But in order to satisfy man's immemorial yearing for unknown worlds, a solution was found. lt was a social, valuable and morally not irrelevant solution. And thus outer space filled with a swarm of penitentiary space cruisers. l was looking forward to your arrival. Where am l? Well, this is our planet. Australia 458. And you? After all, you would be sorry to arrive and not to find a soul, wouldn't you? Here you are. Wake up. Well? That's a nice chippy l've found for you. This little tart is good not just for starters. How do you like it? Front entry? l am glad she suits your taste. Very glad. You know, it's such big responsibility to choose well. To suit the tastes of someone of whom you know only that he is slated to be a hero. - Well? ls she a good pick? - Yes. l am really happy. l am happy, happy, happy, happy, l am. Well. l have a wallet for you. Please. Now l think it is the right to say good-bye, for l don't want to intrude. Besides, you have a miss, so how should you need me? Mhm, she is sleeping, damn road. They pay her and she is sleeping on duty, silly asshole. - Leave her. - As you wish, as you wish. Here are the keys. Locker number 451 . First go straight, then turn left. l would show you the way, but it's against the regulations. - What about her? - She'll wait, why not. Listen, sir. Have no bones about it. With this pidder you may have it any way for you want, sir. Every way. This way, that way, another way. Especially you, the hero. lt is an honor for such a flozzy. To be frank, l envy her. So, please do not spare yourself at all. Do whatever comes to your mind, no inhibitions. Well? Are you pleased with my job? lt is great happiness, great joy for me to do a service to the hero. Glory to heroes. l shall come to the ceremony and l will be crying, weeping. Do you hear? Owing to you, l already feel concrite. Do you hear? l am weeping. Where do you wish to go? l? l am here to meet your wishes. Maybe you want... l don't know. Coffee? Skinny told me to remind you that you may do anything with me. - l am hungry. - Fine. Will you buy me a roll of bread? A roll of bread? We'll buy... whatever you like. lt's not far from here. At the roadside. - What's your name? - Once. For all of them. Do you want me? Yes. These seats are reclining. Well, what's wrong? Are you an impotent? Do we have to make love in the car? No, but normally they fling themsleves at me the moment we are left alone. - Do you like it this way? - No. There are too many door handles and other edges in the car. That leaves me full of bruises or like this, look. Do you want to go to my place? Can we? l have an excellent, huge bed. l hardly invite anyone to my place. Thank you. Will you join me? No. Go alone. And buy me only a roll of bread, will you? Come on. We'll have a warm dish. l cannot. lt's past midnight and l have not come of age. We'll go together. But... Al usually hangs around there. Better not, do you understand? Who is Al? My employer. You know what? You don't look a hero at all. - You are quite different. - Why? Because you don't have a big belly and a couple of dewlaps. Four hamburgers to take away. Sold out. - Make it four sandwiches. - Sold out. What is not? Layer cake and hot dogs. Want some. They're fresh. Four, to take away. Twenty. What is this?! Oh. l am very sorry, sir. You know, l have such a shitty staff. lt will never, never repeat again. You son of a... Lodge complaints with the manager. l am very sorry. Here's to the hero! You've forgotten the hot dogs. My sweet hero. My pretty. lt's me, the whole of me for you. Yeah. Spank me, beat me. Everything is paid for. Get out. l see. You want to have me like an animal, amidst nature. Ha, ha, the wild away. lt's fantastic! l don't want you. But, my teddy-bear. Don't be scared. l can warm up your little cock. - Trust my experience. - Get out. An old man without balls. Let me tidy myself, hero. Where is the girl who was here before you? - Once? - Yes. That's where it hurts you. That's what you want. A young piece of ass. An unridden pussy. But do you think she can pull it off, that titless amateur? Do you think she is a better treat than me? Just tell me where she is. Where should she be? Her 1 0-hour duty was over and they took her away. As a minor she has no right to overtime. Hey, you! Listen, give me a lift to the town, will you? My boss is in the bar. lt would be awkward to show him you've rejected me. Please, give me a lift. You may dump me off anywhere. You said they took Once away. Do you know where? Home, to sleep. Why? There is no exploitation of minors. The regulations take care of them. Anyhow, l have no reasons to complain, either. l am happy. We all are happy here. The point is to do... to like what you do. Do you know where she lives? And what do you expect? Should l play her mom? You should have asked Al in the bar. You are really hooked. The baby cast a spell. Stay here. lt'll be good. An old fag. Run, rush your hot dog to that chick. lnsert your dick in her and spit out that drop of glue. How comical you are, puff, puff, puff, when you move like monkeys on a string, puppets. What for? What for? You sell out anything for not having to jerk it off alone. Just to prod, prod, prod, mangle, damn it. What are you?! What? Heroes! What? What are you wise guys? You're slaves. Slaves of the vulva. What are you? lntellect. Art. All that is rubbish when you get a hard-on. All is rubbish, rubbish, rubbish. Slaves! You fucking sperm-makers, who beg for being stroked and cuddled. What do you want? - l am supposed to live here. - Have you a written authorization? l have one. No photo, and the name is missing. Because l have just... - Sort of a hero, aren't you? - That's what it says. Occupation: hero. Address precisely this one. You don't look a hero. Why? Why? You are without a lady. No company at all. You are not appropriately dressed and here is the place only for heroes. All heroes sleep here. l am a hero. You may go in. You have an amiable look. Do you prefer the right-hand side, or the left-hand side. You have come first, so you may choose. The middle side. You are quite a joker. l'll give you one on the right-hand side. lt's quieter. You know, l am already losing hope for the one from the middle side to arrive. We've been waiting and waiting for long years and all in vain. The rooms are up the stairway. Good night. lf you have coupons for meals, l can serve you a warm dish. l don't. l'll collect them tomorrow. Or l can make tea for you. Without a coupon, a gift of the heart. No thank you. Good night. Traditionally, as every year, whales landed in a huge mass on our beeches to commit group suicide. Organized, school package tours marvel at this educative wonder of nature and use the opportunity to touch the sympathetic animals. The mysterious instinct which propels our largest mammals to group suicide is the object of thorough investigations. Didn't wake you up, by the way? No, no. Take no trouble. Having breakfast. Health comes first. Do you like eggs? l know what heroes like. Eggs. My goodness. We do take care of the heroes. As you wish, of course. Sorry, but it's just out of kindness. Well, well. What is the human mind not capable of? But first of all eat. When your stomach is full, the world is more beautiful. Very well, very well. You keep eating, while l unpack the gifts. Here we are. A portable garrote. Very easy to use. Slices through the neck like through butter. This is... a bomb. You board a bus, you leave the bomb behind. You get off and the bomb goes off. Rush hours is the best time. Very spectacular. Here we have knives, bodkins and daggers. Use them as you wish. And finally the latest invention. A rapid- fire... automatic sub-machine gun. 500 rounds per minute. You like it already. And now a private gift from myself. The slippers. You know, years of practice. l know that heroes brush it off, but the slippers is a vital thing. lt's to prevent you from catching a cold and getting snotty at some celebrated moment. Please. Excuse me, one more thing to satisfy my human curiosity. What crimes do you relish? - l? - Yes, you. l don't. Come on. Never, on no rap? Recalcitrance. Quite a jester. Have you any toothbrush. No, but l'll bring it later. Yes. Now l still want to give you money. Count it, please. Here are coupons for meals. Kindly sign the receipt, please. Right here. The money and the wallet is yours. lt's for drinks to keep you at ease. Well? Shall we go? Where? To the scene of torture. Things used to be much better, sir. Wherever a hero appeared, there was a retinue, marchpasts, horses in a parade, people where throwing flowers. Now, you see. There's technocracy. And the spirit is almost gone. l am not complaining, but is it right to save at the expense of heroes. lt's not nice. l still have another gift for you. l've almost forgotten. lt's a pendant for keys. You press here and it's moving. Funny, isn't it? And the keys won't get lost. Please. Last night there was a young girl at the airfield. Later she's got lost. There are too many of those tarts hanging around. Once there was an idea to stone adulteress. l bet people would like it. The idea was dropped. But if it was up to me, sir. l would show them. Do you know where l could find that girl? - Pardon? - Her name is Once. So you want her? Yes. Certainly, you may. A hero may anything. You are lucky. All of them take care about you. Gifts, girls and all that. l envy you... That you are a hero... And take whatever you want. l could not do it. l am simply not bold enough. Do you understand? Oh, we have made it. lt's a nice place. Now take a look around. You'll like the idea. Now, there is a mess. But soon they will deck the stand with a red carpet and flowers. lt will be beautiful. Spectators will come. They haven't cleaned it up again. Where to, where to? We are going there. You'll stay here with us. Where do you want to run? What for? Here, sir, here. Please. No. Not this. We don't need it. No. We have all we need here. And what have we here? Wow, it's almost history. A whip for initial flogging. lt's outdated. We give up. lt's barbarian. But, you know, some heroes like it. What else have we got. A blackboard. lt's not for you. And look, it's a device for crushing shin-bones. You hold it like this, bang, crunch! And the shin-bones are gone. Anaesthesia. You won't feel a thing. Formelly, we used more traditional methods. For example, we anaesthetized with herbs. But their taste was awful. Now, we have something better, more advanced. A small injection and it's all over. A prick, an injection, and you won't feel a thing. You see, it's technological progress. l am very much for it. To say the truth, it will be beautiful here. Well, how is it? Do you accept everything? ls everything all right? - Have you any...Remarks? - What? Have you any reservations, wishes? ls everything proper? ls it? So sign here, please. lt's a formality. Regulations, you know. - What am l supposed to sign? - Sorry. lt's the regulations. Order must be. Here. Sign that you agree to becoming a hero and that you accept everything. - Specifically what? - Don't you know? That you will commit a crime and we will punish you. We'll impale you. Well, will you sign? My hands are freezing. No. l see, you are irritated. Sure. Don't sign anything. No, what for? As a matter of fact, l am against red tape. You'll sign everything at one stroke at the end. Slang, bang! l can do anything for you. Let's go. You do realize that it is actually against the regulations, but l could reserve one for you. Which one do you prefer? - Right of left? - What? Hush, come over here. This is the right one, over there is the left one. - So what? - Look, sir. Here is a concrete-lined hole, just to avoid digging it over again. Farmers bring a pale, sir, and a malefactor is impaled. Afterwards, the pale is put in the hole and it's standing. And the malefactor rides it deeper and deeper by his own weight. Hell, what a ceremony! Sir, the whole stadium will be watching you, while you're high up there. What would it be without men like you. Though, on the other hand, you know, sir, the fate of a hero is hard-earned money, don't you think? And what am l? What am l? A mere bureaucrat, sir. What about the middle pale? You're quite a joker. Well, which one do you choose. The right one, or the left one? - l trust your choice. - Thank you very much. l shall appreciate it. Lunch time. What now? l'll have some exercise. Jogging. Will you jog with me? No. As you like. One more thing. Later, my colleague will contact you. You won't hesitate to sign everything for him. And, sir, please don't be afraid at all. The anaesthesia is complete. The pales are smooth and sharp. My regards. l've recognized you at once. You heroes radiate something elusive, inimitable. something l sense a kilometre apart. l am from television. - Did you know l was coming? - l know life. Hero or no hero, everyone is keen on a piece of ass. You would come here sooner or later. - l want to go from here. - One moment please. - How about a shot? - Not now. You may tell me in secret when you are going to commit a crime. You see, we want to show to the people your true, as it were, repulsive image. Please, let me persuade, will you? l haven't made up my mind yet. One way or another, we are waiting. To your success. One more thing. Will you agree to an interview while you are impaled? The important thing for me is a ladder, because if you agree, l will have to climb the ladder at the scene of torture to reach you high up there the pale. And l suffer from vertigo. How will it be? Would you like to hold an interview? Sir, You know, l am even prepared to climb that damn ladder, especially for you, though for me it's a big trouble, trouble, trouble. Mister hero, mister hero, excuse me boldness, but l and my husband would like together... Together with hero, at one table. - Just for a moment. - lf you don't spurn it. Please. . . My daughter. She is blind, poor thing, a cataract. Such misfortune. Today is our child's birthday. Our life is modest, but sufficient. Yes, quiet and happy. Happy. And l sometimes ask myself whether we deserve to live in such magnificent times. The cataract is curable. Yes, it is a pity that our little child cannot see this wonderful world. - Can't she shave a surgery? - lt's very expensive. - We cannot afford it. - How much? Much. Very much. Even the heroes don't get that much. Well, if you have any change money left before the ceremony, money you won't need anymore, we will accept it with gratitude. Maybe one day we'll raise enough for the surgery. Don't make our hero worry with our problems. He has his own worries. Will you write a dedication for our child? This is our family visitors' book. Look how many heroes have had their layer cake in our company. Well, l'll be going now. Thank you. - And a small gift for you. - What? Vaseline. You'll need it to grease the pale before the ceremony. They always promise it, but when it comes to the real thing, they forget such trifles. And this is important for you. Thank you. We thank you. Bow to mister hero. Do you fancy the baby? l can send her for you along with breakfast. You are so lonesome. And she has no excess of pleasures, either. The pale is coming into the anus of the hero, bursting through the sphincter... ...penetrating the rectum... piercing it... passing through the midriff. Let's see how it looks in practice. The hero should hold straight, for if he kicks away, the pale may pop out... through his belly. And in that case he'll have to be impaled again. l am waiting for you. Unobtrusively, because l did not dare disturb you... in that your secluded place for heroes. l just wonder why you are so abstinent? - What? - l mean your sexual abstinence. So, why didn't you have a go at her? Do you mean Once? Yes, yes. That baby with little tits. Didn't you like her? l did. She is very pretty. So why did you not copulate her? Tell me, are you ashamed? Listen, sir, the time of obscurantism and superstition is over. You need a touch of eroticism, female body, warmth. Besides, it clears up your mind. Please have a fling with her, please, will you? Why do you care so much? They take me to account for satisfying the heroes. This is my duty. All right. l'll do it for you. l am very pleased. Thank you, sir, thank you. No, no need, it's very close, round the corner. You know, the ceremony is getting close and l always get the shivers from there to here. You may laugh at me, but l fell really moved when l envision you up there in convulsions, while l'll be watching. l'll get me binoculars and l'll be watching you, watching until you breathe your last. Until your last breath. No, no, it's here. Now. The first floor, the door to the left. l'll find it. Enjoy yourself. My heart is with you. Do you always leave the door open? No. Only when l expect someone. Were you expecting a hero? l was expecting... ...you. So now we can lock it up. Oh yes. Shall l undress? He was raping a minor, inspector, he has raped a minor. lnspector! The evidence. Yes, sir. The evidence. The evidence. Protect the evidence and the minor. This is exactly what you'll be stuffed with. We've brought it earlier for you to get used to it. But you show no enthusiasm. You are sad hero, aren't you? Everybody is sad. But you have to commit some crime. After all, you are a hero. Well, think of something, you little flag, come on pussy, come on. Excellent, very good. But the boys were not ready yet. Now come on. Bang it, pussy-face, bang it. l told you. Did you hear? Bang it. You saw it inspector. He tore away the arm of a representative of the authority, who was discharging the duties connected with the execution of his official functions. Have you the evidence? The inspector is asking whether you wish to send a print to your family. Well, and so we have worked it out somehow. A rape of a minor and a heavy mutilation of a representative of the authority. This is something. Still this is not exactly what we want. We do appreciate your efforts, l assure you, but all of your crimes so far are not spectacular enough. They are parlour stuff. No, we are not finding fault with you, but just tell us what use can be made of these. After all, they are posed photos, good for the gutter press. lt's a cottage job, while we are living in the 21 st century. Television rules the imagination of the mob. Blood, live action, plenty of dead. Do you know what l mean? Yeah. You don't trust me, and l sense it. But our intentions are pure. Just think. You commit a nightmarish crime. Best in broad daylight, while the crowd is watching. Mass media are on the scene. Can you realize the great benefits which the community derives from witnessing the exemplary punishment of something hideous. How rare and edifying it is to watch a crime which is punished. Could l not be punished for nothing. As simple as that. l know what you mean. l am also sensitive. l don't even catch fish. l abhor blood and violence. Eyes. Will you have coffee with fresh milk? Thank you. Of course we could do without a crime. But punishment without a crime is immoral. Don't you think? l trust that you can bring yourself up to some jolly good crime. You know, something spontaneous, with a luster. Blood, raw flesh, entrails out. This is what impresses people, you know. Something which is stomach-turning. Sentimentalism works well on villains. Will you do it? - l'll think of it. - Well. So sign here. No. - What no? - l won't sign. - Why? - l don't want to. Are you comfy in an armchair? So look to your side. That stool is for normal citizens. So far you've been sitting in an armchair, you understand? To be a hero, it obligates. You see? An intellectual will always find a common language with another intellectual. What did you write here? Ga, ga. Ga, ga? The sound that children make. l see. Children make ga, ga. Good. Very good. Ga, ga. Well. lt can be. l am not a formalist. After all, an act of good will is what counts. Now look. People really adore you. There is another hero. You will meet. He will be next to you on the pale. But he is more cooperative. And...who will be on the middle pale? The middle pale will be unoccupied. But we are not losing hope. We are waiting and ready every year. May l leave? Of course, of course. You have signed. You are free. - And the girl? - Which girl? The one l raped. She is free too. We are all free people. You know, sometimes a thought comes to me that freedom is conscious heroism. Look how churlish it is! l understand when bedclothes are bloodstained. But to deflower her on the floor?! Even walls are stained. Deviated! They say he banged her so hard that they had to smash windows. Heroes, heroes. Haven't you seen a girl? Young and slim? Milord, girls here change every hour. Anyway, l am also a girl. l mean the one which that pervert banged. l know nothing. l am not authorized. Ask the manager. He is in charge. Once you're going, give this to Al. Tell him l've found it under the couch. l read in newspapers that if you get it in time, you can stitch it back. l am looking for a girl, a very young blonde. No hard feelings, please. The hot-dogs which l recommended to you last night were quite fresh. l ate them myself. l assure you all we sell is fresh. - l am looking for a girl. - There are no bitches around here. This is a reputed facility, without them bitches. What about the man?. His name is Al, the manager. They say he stays here. l don't know. l only serve the guests. l only make hot-dogs. Bitches are not my province. Are you looking for me? Are you Al? Yeah. Once, a slim blonde is working for you. All of them work for me. Are you missing the little girl? l am looking for her. No reason for shame. Tearful feelings are hard to come by now. l am looking for her. You are looking for one little baby? Your requirement are not too high for a hero. But you don't want to be a hero. l want to find Once. Just for nothing? Just with your head up? l understand you, but there is no way. Nothing for nothing. You have to stick in the mud here, like all the rest. What do you mean? You see, the natural course of events is like this. A crime, a reward, a punishment. You are particularly lucky. A big crime, a big reward, and... But by common sense, there is no need to worry. Everyone meets his predetermined end. Just think of others. Small meanness, small sins, small satisfaction and they die anyway. This is what we call the weekday heroism. We all are heroes. But you are a hero with a pomp, with honor. l envy you. Do you believe me? Let's make a deal. Your turn now. You see, l am a pimp. l prey on others' prostitution. What do you want? What do l want for the want? - For Once? - Yes. She's an excellent, young product. - A bagful. - Of what? Or two bagfuls of money. l can take twice as much for you, for example. l am not your whore. lt's misunderstanding. l don't deal with whores. l deal with people, and only with those who wish it themselves. All right. l'll get the money for you. Do you like our planet? - lt's hideous. - Don't say. ls yours any better? Good day. This is a hold-up. This is a hold-up. All l want is money. Stay quiet and you'll be all right. Shut up. Get the bags and pack the money. Throw the gun here. ls it enough? Yes! - There is no more. - Will do. Great! One bag is yours and the other is mine. We, heroes, must help each other. We, heroes... Well, well. The money. One bag is no good. There were to be two. Enough for you. Let the girl out. Two bags. A portable garrote. Easy to handle. You needn't have taken sugar wool from me. Here ls the money for your daughter's eye surgery. A whole bag, a whole bag. But it is enough for ten surgeries. Our benefactor! lf there is anything left, donate it to the whale protection fund. A miracle, a miracle! My daughter can see. She's recovered her sight. She can see. My daughter. A miracle, a miracle. Mister hero, the pales are ready. lt was a crime of a genius. To kill a partner to take over his spoils. We all admire you. You were magnificent. l may offer you a concession. Do you want? Do you want? We shall impale you together with the girl. And we'll send the photo coverage of the ceremony back to your family. Bravo! You, did you make sure that the flag is fixed well on the surface of the virgin planet? Don't talk. Take off. l won't take off, unless l am sure that the flag is fixed well. What a junkyard! The flag is the most important. This is breakdown computer speaking, cockroach... You pay 40 guilders penalty, convertible to 1 00 days in jail for breaking the glass without a reason. We will not take off anywhere, because our penitentiary cruiser is still too far. All you must do is to sit down on your ass, wait and rejoice at being alive. Take off, fool. Have your guilders? Come on. Come on. l am just reviving up my engines. Come on. Take off immediately. - Course for the Earth? - No, the nearest planet without people. l read you. The nearest planet without people. ...and they lived happily ever after. Authoring DVD: CatMusic
