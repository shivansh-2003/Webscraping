Two pairs of socks, that's the key. Key to what? Key to staying fresh and feeling good, you know? What you do is you keep an extra pair of socks in your pocket, one in your lunch pail. Around 2:00, 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon you slap those bad boys on, bam, you feel like a million bucks. I'll have to remember that. Yeah. I hope you don't mind our first meeting being down here whilst I'm taking a walk. No, it's no problem. You looking for a job? Yeah, I'm getting something lined up. Oh, really? That's good. What have you got? Uh, body work. Nice. You know, I'm going to need to see your pay stubs on a regular basis. You can have some alcohol, but no drugs. We do random drug testing. And you know about the travel restrictions? Yeah, yeah, I'm not going anywhere. And you know the number one thing that makes all parolees go back to jail? Not enough socks? No. Stay away from all known felons and former criminal associates. If I find you break that condition, you go directly back to jail. You do not pass go. You do not collect $200. Am I clear? Yeah, crystal. Good. You know, Vince, I'm going to be watching you. I'm looking out for you, man, I got your back. Lucky me. Ha! I sent you guys out to do an easy job. What the fuck happened to you? Couldn't find Vince? No, we got him right here. Mother of God. Get him out of there! Which one of you did this, you? You told us to bring him here. Not in the trunk, asshole. Come on in, Vince. What? Sit him down. You don't seem like yourself, Vince. And I don't mean 'cause of what these two did to you. You could always take a beating, couldn't you? Get me a couple of glasses and some ice water, will you? I invited him to come see you. And he declined. Oh, he declined, did he? Yeah, he said, "No fucking way." Actually, he said that he couldn't. Well, if that is truly the case, then you should have phoned me and told me that he had declined, and I would have personally invited him. I confronted him and he told us to fuck off. So Dean whacked him with a tire iron and started kicking him on the ground. You never learn, do you? Never, ever learn. Jackie, take him to the paint room. No, Mr. K... Shut up, Dean, Aah! you're just going to make it worse for yourself. Fuck, Jackie! Larry, stay where you are. I figured you were going to come straight to me. What were you thinking? You forget me? Yeah. You're my favourite, you know that? You should have told that to the new guy. Everybody knows. But Dean's got an inferiority complex. I, uh... It's true, Larry. Larry thinks he's just an asshole. He's good at his job. Great. Not as good as you. This is my first day out. I'm not going back to jail. Not... I mean, not for you, not for anybody. I'm done stealing cars. You got another way to pay me back the money you owe me? I gave you five years, figured, you know, five... You figured wrong. Drink your water. It was my money in that bag you threw over that bridge. You always said that if we got trapped, dump the goods. Where it can be recovered. I was road-blocked on that bridge. My money. I want it back. The vig on that starts today. You got that, Larry? Yes sir, Mr. Kranski. I could have been out in two. Instead, I kept my mouth shut. Out in two? Yeah. In a pine box. You act as if you had a choice. You didn't have a choice. You don't have a choice now, sweetheart. The Mezalis, the crazy Lithuanians, they got a ship I got to fill up with high-end cars. You do that, you pay off your debt. Need help getting up? I want you to see Vince home. And send Dean back in. I want to see where he's at. You're the best car thief I ever saw. It's a gift. Man's got a gift, he's got a duty to use it. Use it, Vince, that's who you are. I'll open 'em, I'll start 'em, but I don't drive 'em. Those Mezalis, they'll feed you to their dogs, dawg. - Straight up. - He's right, you know, Latvian fucking wolf hounds, Vince. A lot's changed since you got sent up. Mr. K. wants us to bring you up to speed. Here to learn, Sensei. Yeah, that's funny, son. This shit costs Mr. K. a lot of money. It comes from the Chinese and the Israelis. That's right, it's that kosher chow mein shit right there. Dean, Dean, just shut the fuck up, okay! So you punch in the VIN, take the jimmy key, you put it in the frequency generator, it changes the code on the chip inside the key. Okay? Cool. Cool. And you think this thing's faster than me? Pss... Well, we're going to find out. Dean, you take the Benz. I'll take that Honda. You'll take that Honda? Yeah, it's man against machine. Yeah, I'll fight. I will destroy you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, just wait a sec. You ready? Okay. On your mark... get set... go! 19, 45... 6, 18. All right I got you, jailbait. Maybe you need to take your remedial typing class. Just let me type, man, just... Oh, that's right, just let me... you dropped out of school in fourth grade. I went to junior college, motherfucker. How you doing over there, Vinnie? It's like riding a bike... all the way back to prison. He's in. Yeah, yeah, he's in, all right, but he hasn't started that fucking shit yet. Maybe you should go check the VIN again, numb nuts. Come on, baby. No! Fucking... Nice. That's it, I want a re-do. - I want a re-do. - No re-dos. Larry, you can take that Honda. Oh sure, I'll get right on that, Vince. And, Dean, if you can crack that Benz, drive it to the warehouse. Man, who made you boss, yo? Kranski's deal, man. I open them, I start them up, but I don't drive them, all right? Here. Where you going? Getting the fuck away from you guys. Man, never mind. Fuck him. I got my best guy back. You got nothing to worry about. It'll be a piece of cake. Vince, there's a case of Glenfiddich in the storeroom. Do you like Glenfiddich? Yeah. Yeah. Bring it out to Mr. Mezali's car, will you? This deal is good. Very good. Larry, where's my old stuff? What old stuff? My stuff, man. The stuff I was doing out back. Vince, you're not going to start that shit up again, are you? Oh, I had to toss that, yo. Look, man, I got some old titty mags in the can if you want to blow off some steam. Titty mags. Thanks, man. You know, five years' practice, I think I'm ready for the real thing. The boss don't like you crowding up his space, you know that. Hey, we got to do some work. Pick up some Benzos. You don't want to end up in there. Hey. Hey, Vince. What, do you live here now? Look, Kranski needs you to go pick him up. All right. All right. What, right now? No, tomorrow morning, Einstein. Take the Lincoln. We drop him off, you pick him up. You better get with the program, man, it'll hurt less. Here... this is the address. Okay. Okay. Kristen, can you hear me now? Belinda... For fuck's sake! Belinda, I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? Well, can you find a better signal? Oh, sure, why don't I just scale the fucking CN Tower? So hard to find a damn phone that works. Be... Belinda? Oh, good God, what the hell? Hey! Trying to get your ass run over, lady? Don't you know pedestrians have the right of way, you dipshit? Oh yeah, oh yeah? Oh yeah? Since when? Since read the traffic book! Oh, but you probably can't read, can you? Goddammit, look at my car! Oh yeah, that's just the front bumper, it's knocked loose. That takes about a half an hour labour, tops. Give me your information, tough guy. You can fantasize about slapping me around when you're asking people if they want fries with that. Hello! Insurance! License! Yeah, yeah, about that. Could we possibly maybe do this one off the record? Sure. No problem. Good. Is the number for 911 still 9-1-1? All right. How about you take this car to my shop, I fix it up? Then you can drive off like nothing ever happened. Why would I do that? Because, uh, you know what? I could drive off right now. And then what would you do? Take down your license plate number. All right. How about I throw in a couple of hundred bucks for your time? 500, it's a deal. Jesus! Fine, all right. Follow me. Well, if I were there, I wouldn't be here, Kristen! No, you're going to have to get your head out of your armpit and go down there and make sure they installed it right, Kristen. Kristen... Yo, yo, miss! Uh... Don't... lady.... What is this? It's none of your business. Seriously, who made this? Hey, don't do that. Why, did you steal it? No. Uh... It's mine, I made it. You made this? Yeah. What's it to you? W... I mean, it's good. Like, really, really good. Like, in an outsider kind of way. Outsider. Outsider kind of... insider. I mean, this is Red Foot and Klassen. Now, Red Foot shanked Klassen in the cafeteria. Rumour had it Klassen had ripped off Red's meth so... Are you talking about prison? Yeah. Do a lot of people get stabbed in the eye where you work? I work in the art world. People get stabbed all the time, just... usually not in the eye. I'm a gallerist. Belinda. Bloome. Guess that makes me a guy-a-rist. Cute. Vince. Your car. Your car... your car's ready. So, Vince, what were you in for? Gee, Miss, uh, Bloome, uh, none of your business. Think you got anymore Red Foots in you? That's not really Red Foot and Klassen, that's just... just something I made. I don't know what it is. I do. You know, I'm hosting a small opening at OCAD tomorrow night. Some very interesting conceptual pieces. Well, a few might be interesting, but... if you'd like to join us... Open bar? Just wine. You have to bring your own meth. Oh, right, almost forgot. Um... Oh, no, no. Keep it, forget it, forget it. - Don't want it. - Vincent! If you think phoning to say that you got waylaid satisfies... Oh, you did get waylaid. Uh, so anyway, um... come on by. We'll talk. John Kranski. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure it is. Goodbye to you too. You been doing some body work, huh? Yeah. Want a piece of advice? Yeah. Women with tiny breasts are better in bed. Huh! True! I'll keep that in mind. Where you going? Going to change my socks. What the fuck, man? Oh, shit, son. I'm sorry I didn't see you there. No diss, huh? Yeah, sure, no diss. Sir, you can't park there. Careful you don't scratch it, Dorian. Why am I here? There's nothing to buy here. Why'd she bring me here? Look at this shit. It's like I'm not here to buy... Look, back up from this. This is knitting. I-I don't collect knitting. This is... bullshit. Man, times are hard on the boulevard. Kristen, why don't you put down your Master's degree and pick one of these up? Trays and drinks aren't really my area of expertise. Damn, you have an area of expertise? You're good. Thank you. Oh, shit! I mean... thank you. Drink a lot of those? I... I wish. It's... it's the heels. You should try a pair of these. Makes your feet smell, but, uh... very stable. Good to know. You know, for my money, this is the best piece in the show. Not that I have any money. Neither do I. Are you an artist? Oh, no. No, no, no, I'm just looking around. Hey, it'll mess you up if I take two? Are you kidding? Take all of them. Less to spill. Thanks. Thanks. "Untitled". "Untitled". I got a title for you: "Don't Sit Here". When I met him he was nothing more than a taxidermist and now the AGO is clamouring for these. I might as well be selling Hummers. There's not one original voice. It is like it's all, uh... the comic book characters. Oh! God! Look at my fucking jacket! You stupid... Not with that. - Get some club soda. - I'm so sorry. You stupid bitch. I'm so sorry. No, no, please. Just don't. Please, get away from me. Stop it. I... I... Excuse me. Goddammit... You know what? What, what? Who are you? Some people say use club soda, Hey, hey, hey! but I say fight fire with fire. Get the... Hey, Get away from me! Get your hands off me! You know what? You should apologize to the girl. You shouldn't call her a stupid bitch! I didn't! I called him a stupid bitch! I didn't call her a stupid... Who's the stupid bitch? Vince, let go! He didn't call me a stupid bitch. Let go, Vince! Let go. You shouldn't call anybody a stupid bitch. Julie, I am so, so sorry. Hey, Gremlin, time to go. What, not one last drink? No. Do your thing, man. Julie, I'm so sorry, but I am so glad that you met him. Do not let him go. - Him, who? - Vince. Uh... oh. Go. Oh! Go. Go. What do I do with that? Julie, listen. I have to show you something. You're going to love this. He is a massive talent. I can't put my jacket... His work is raw and he is fresh out of prison. Like, make it, uh, big. Ow, man. Okay, you earned your pay. You can let me go now, Dorian. Come on, I let you look good in there. You let me look good? I know it hurts like shit. Don't fight it, man, just try and breathe. You're going to be okay. Vince! Hope you didn't scratch my car. Wait! Hello. Hi. I'm Kristen, Belinda's assistant. Hey, Kristen, Belinda's Assistant. Sorry about the mess. Oh no, really, Uh, not a problem. If we could just go back... inside, that'd... would be great. Give me all your money or you're fucking dead. I had you shitting your pants, son. You're fucking hilarious, Dean. Check out my new knife, man. It's a SWAT, special tactical, man. I got a bigger one at home, but this is my new baby. Yeah, that... See that? That's real nice, man. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. The streets are a lot safer with you on them, man. That's right. Hey, junk man. Here. Don't ever say I never gave you nothing. What's this for? That's your cut. Cut for what? Well, you know, that gay shit you got in the back. Some blond chick came by to pick it up with a guy in a big truck. I got to tell you, man, that... thing, it was fucking heavy. Yo, Vince, you bonin' that chick, man? Man, she's pretty, eh? I just want to brush her hair and shit. Ah, fuck. She got the... with the... and the... Fuck, dude. Yo, fuck you, man! Hey, where you going? We got a run to do. For the Mezalis! Hey, I've got to call you back. Where is she? She in there? No, she's in a... Hey, wait! Come back! I wouldn't go... in... there. Well, don't keep us in suspense. Do you like a Brazilian or a Full Monty? Where is it? Took two men to get it here. You're lucky you're not a man, 'cause you know what, you'd be dead right now. Well, thank God I'm presenting evidence to the contrary. You stole this. I sold it. Sold it? Kristen, go get Vince's cheque. Fact is, an important collector just bought it. He saw that photo of Red Cat and whatever and just got all pant, pant, pant, "Got to have it." Kristen! Let me get this straight. You... got... you got somebody to give you money for this thing? How much you sell it for? Fifteen. Hundred? Thousand. For what, for that? Yeah. I just made you a lot of money. This is for six. Bloome Gallery takes 60%. Without me, you're nothing more than an ex-con banging away at a bunch of rusty old car parts in a low-end garage. So, why were you in prison? Grand theft auto. Really? Yeah. Stole a few cars. Got mixed up in some stuff, you know. Huh. Not so sexy. Okay, let's see, you're... an emerging artist with a shady criminal past. Very temperamental. You did time for a crime you don't like to talk about. And you learned it all in C Block. C Block was for child molesters. D Block, whatever. It doesn't matter. The point is, it's all in how you sell it. Art is whatever people say it is. Or what other people tell them it is. It can't be that easy. It isn't. That's why we're here. To promote you so you can create and we can all get rich. How many more rich collector friends you got? How fast do you work? Pretty fast. Great. You work fast, I'll sell fast. You can expect to triple your take. Just don't break any laws. Kristen will work on your schedule with you. Oh, Vince, you didn't tell me how it looks. Looks like you're giving birth to Hitler. Carmella-a-a! Can I possibly get this in cash? Trouble with the banks? I can make it out to cash if that's easier. No. I can wait. Oh, hey, can I get your number? She's a pit bull, but she knows what she's doing. Pit bulls are sweeter. Are you going to be up to this? Uh-huh. Because it's going to get harder and harder and you're going to have to do it again and again and again. And... What? Did we stray off topic here? N... no, no. I'm just trying to say that you... I get it. Can I get your number? I don't date artists. Who said I'm an artist? Strictly business. Ow-w-w-w! Strictly business. Right. Right. What are you doing here? I must have just passed out. Doing your crap. Yep. It's not crap, it's working. Ha! Go get yourself cleaned up. I'll take you out to breakfast. Then I got to go meet my parole officer. These cards suck. Don't they always. Hurry up, I'm starving. Any pay stubs for me yet? Uh, no, you know, I'm still waiting for my first cheque. You know, they hold them. Yeah, they do that. Body work, right? Yeah, body work. Hey, I, uh... I got that extra pair of socks. You know, I put them on in the afternoon and I... I felt like a million bucks. That's great. Yeah. I'm going to need some pee. Where? In here. So how's your boss? He's fine, I guess. No, I mean, like, how is he to work for? Independent, franchise, what's the story? Mr. Pogue... Mmm-hmm. I can't do this. What? I can't pee in this jar right now. All right. Nervous bladder, huh? Now listen to me, okay? Close your eyes. Close your eyes. I saw this on TV. Focus. Think relaxing thoughts. Let all the tension and stress flow through your body. Take everything and stream it through into the central sprinkler system that God has given you. Direct it to the penis and let it go. Huh? What'd I tell you? Easy peasy. Ooh... Cheers. I'm here to help you, you know. If there's anything you ever want to talk to me about... I mean, anything. You know, sometimes the pressure to backslide can be very strong. Yeah. You don't have to worry about me, Mr. Pogue. Hey... Hey! That's my car! Hey! Yeah. Tonight? Strictly business, right? What do you think? What am I doing here? Belinda wanted you to come. She's around here somewhere. Hey, you sell my new thing yet? Oh, fuck. I thought you liked it. No, not that, it's... ...him, my ex and his arm candy. He's the reason I don't date artists. Kristen. Hey, Carl. This is Daphne, my fianc?e. Hey, how are you? Fianc?e? Wow! Uh, congratulations. - Thank you. - Vince, this is Carl. Carl was the hit at the Art Frise two years ago. Yeah, last summer. Vince, here is also an artist. Oh, yeah? What do you do, Vince? Vincent. Vincent, Vincent. Uh, I do... I do... It's easier if I show you what I do. Oh! Mmmm... Hey... Okay, all right. Oh... Oh, come here. Ah! Oh-h-h... Carl, me, I'm sorry, but you know, my life... my life is my art. I cannot control myself. Mmm! Mmm! - Mmm! Mmm... - Hey, well done, Kristen. Whatever the fuck you're into now. Did you see the look on Carl's face? You should have seen the look on yours. Thank you for doing that. And where did you learn such French, Monsieur? I had a cellmate from Chicoutimi. So who's the better kisser? You mean between the two of them? No, between the three of us. I'd have to give that to Carl. Oh, well, then things have changed because he wasn't that good before. Maybe we should have a run-off before I award the best prize. I've got to... I've got to go. Hey... I thought we were just kidding around. I-I... I didn't... I didn't mean... Oh, God. Excuse me. Excuse me. Vince! There you are. Would you please come up here? There's someone I want you to meet. Who am I meeting? Vince, you remember Julian? The important collector who bought your piece? He bought my piece? Come here, you fucking genius, you. No, y... you come here, you man of wealth and taste. Ah, I... I love your piece. I love it. Good. I love that you love it. Yeah, come, come, come, come. You and I, uh, we have a long... No, no, no, you come, you come sit with me. We have a... a long relationship, you and I, artist and collector. Mm-hmm. And I want to talk to you, uh, about a commission. Commission? - What's a commission? - I-I want you to create a piece for me, personally. How much we talking here? Oh, no, no, you don't have to worry about that. You let me worry about that. Huh. He's new at this. No, that's... that's good, I like it. He's direct, I like that. Listen, you tell me what you want, I'll make it. Fantastic. That's, uh... We'll set up a meeting, discuss the aesthetic parameters and that's that. That's it. That's it? That's it. You're very talented. Hey... Thank you. Come by later and get your cash. Very talented. Yes, he is. Congratulations. Congratulations to you. Yeah. If you're listening to this, I'm either working or I ran away from home. Leave a message. Bye. Belinda? In here. You got a nice place. See anything you like? You got a lot of stuff, uh... Cool stuff, I guess. Don't guess. Be a mystery. I can do that. Uh, you got my cash? Boy, you just get right down to the point, don't you? Well, you know, five years in jail, not much time left to waste. It's a real coup, you know, Julian commissioning a piece. Good. How much? All in good time, Vince. Come here. Let me show you something. Hitler? Is that you? No, no, these, actually. I thought you'd like them. So listen... You want to know how much you're worth. You know I don't like you, right? Right. Okay. How long has it been? You mean with girls? Ambiguity is so hot. Oh-h-h! Shhhh! All right, shhh! Oh, God! Fucking hell. You all right? You sleep with all your artists? Sleep? You doze off in the middle there? I'm glad to hear you're calling yourself an artist. I'll be right back. Hey, it's Kristen. I think you called. Sorry I... I ran out like that tonight. I just couldn't handle seeing Carl and his perky fianc?e. But, uh, anyway, hope you made out okay with Belinda and I will see you tomorrow morning at the gallery. Okay, bye. Keep it up, Vince. There's a lot more where that came from. Hey! - What the fuck! - Get in the car. You're crazy. Get in the car. No, you know what? I think I'm safer walking. Not with your head down, you're not. I give you a job to do and you're strutting around town like some kind of gigolo. Gigolo? That's an idea. Don't you play smart with me. I'm working on paying you off. What else do you want? I want you on the job. I need you sharp or I don't need you at all. Clear? Crystal. Hey. You called? You called. After you. Yep. So how'd it go last night? Belinda said you were amazing. Sealing the deal with Julian. Right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it went fine. What are you doing? Blowing. It's part of my job. Wow, you do that very well. Well, are you ready to go? Yeah. This whole shopping idea was Belinda's, by the way. Why do you put up with her? Why do you? Money. Fame. Chicks. Me too. I've never been to a museum before. Really? I think you'll really like it. How old? When I stole my first car? 13. 13? Wow. Yeah, I... I brought it right back, though. Why? Why did I bring it back? No, why did you steal it? Oh, I just wanted to go for a joy ride. How old were you when you stopped bringing them back? 15. Then I'd bring them up to this huge field and there were so many of them it became like a parking lot. Then this guy found out about it, wanted to buy them. so I sold them all to him. Took me under his wing, it became what I did. I was really good at it. You're good at other things, you know. Hmm. I want something large for right... right here. I'll show you, here. Julian's piece... I want 60-40. Well, that's the quickest I've ever been fucked. I doubt it. 50-50. I can live with it. God, you scared the shit out of me. Come on. What are we doing? A little tour. I want to talk to you. Hey! You just ran that light! Yeah, it's a game I play. Red light, green light. Every red light's green. And the green lights? Uh, they're green too. Keeps me sharp. Hmm. That's good. You know the key to the game, the only thing you have to consider? Where the nearest hospital is. Heh, funny. No, the reaction time of the other drivers. You just watch them. Look! Hey! Get a life! Come on, could we just play old-fashioned red light, green light till I get out of the car? Hey, did you ever look at this whole area? Take a look at it. It's mine. After this deal with Mezali, that's it, I'm out. So who am I going to get to administer things? I thought Larry was your man. No, Larry? No, this needs somebody smart to keep it profitable. You. You're my heir apparent. Soon as you pay off your debt, the keys to this kingdom are yours. I'm glad we had this little chat. Where can I drop you? Hey, you know what? I'll tell you what, I'll buy you a drink. No, that's okay, Mr. K. It's a little early in the day for me. No, I insist. We'll celebrate. Kiss my ass! How's it going, Pete? Hey. Heya, buddy. Some guy's in there, he brought his car in. Yeah? So? What's the problem? He wants you to fix it. Yeah, man, we ain't, like, sir-fix... fix-a-lots, yo. Smells like a cop, Vince. Why would a cop be here? Why would a cop be here, man? Mr. Pogue. Hey, Vince! How you doing? Doing fine. Hey, listen, I got this, uh, squealing in my engine and I figured, what better place to take it to than the shop you work at. Yeah, uh, well, we just do body work, so better not. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, yeah. Oh, hey, you think I can get some pee from you? Oh, yeah. Listen, I'll take a look, see what I can do. Nice touch. Uh-huh. So how's things going in here? Ah, well, you know, it's a little slow with the recession and all, but, uh... Hey, it's hitting everybody, you know. You want to... you want to get in and start it up there, sir? Oh yeah, sure. No problem. You got the magic touch. Hey, hey. Just, uh... just a fan belt, you know? No charge. No charge? No charge, no... No pee, no charge. Gotta pee. No, please. It's just, the guys are here, it's kind of embarrassing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. No problem. Thank you. Hey, where's your boss? I need to talk to him for a minute. He's at the lake. He's a fisherman. You know, just a... and actually, he doesn't come around here all that much. He's... he's hard to catch. Hey, hard to catch and he's a fisherman. Yeah. Go figure. Funny. I guess I'll give him a phone call or something? Yeah. You do that. Yeah. Good idea, that'd... that'd be great. All right, I'm going to get out of your hair. Hey, thanks for that. You're welcome. You're good. Thanks a lot. You keep your nose clean. I'm watching you. It's for your own good, Vince. See you. Yo! What the fuck was that? Uh, that was, uh, that was Joe, okay? He was my bitch in jail. Joe the bitch in jail? Joe the bitch. Joe the bitch does not take his car to a fucking place... Shut the fuck up! We got work to do. You're both a couple of bitches. Go to work. Look at that. Those Mezalis motherfuckers, they love those cars. Whatever. Let me out. Get that shit, son. Come on, man, give me the phone. All right, let's do this. Wait a second. Yo, where... where you going, man? Yo, what are you doing with that thing, man? I don't want that shit in my car, yo! Shut the fuck up, Dean. What are we, garbage men? Come on, man! Fuck! Key. Yeah, here you go, you garbage-picking motherfucker. It doesn't work. Well, try it again, the numbers match. It doesn't work, Dean. Here, the window's open. Come on, Vince. Cops, cops, cops! Shut up. Go! Vince. Hello, yeah. You're good. You need a drink or something? Nah, I'm all right. Great car. Yeah, it's just my favourite yellow car. Yeah. Let me... Let me ask you something. It's a... personal question, okay? Have you ever killed someone? No, no, no. I see that in your work. So you like it? So, how we feeling? I love this piece. Well, I think it's disingenuous. India. India, this is Vince. Vince, India Montkieff, my wife. Vince. India's a curator at the Tate, Vince. Yeah, I asked her to fly in from London to see your work. How do you say "disingenuous"? This piece is fantastic. No, no, his first piece I love, but this one is derivative. Derivative? What do you mean "derivative"? This is beautiful. I love this piece. Well, if he doesn't hear it from me he'll hear it from someone else. I was just trying to give your husband here what he asked for. Pandering. Yes, that's the word I was looking for. Julian, this... this piece just marinates in its eagerness to please you. Are you done? Vince... 'Cause I'm done. Um, you don't want it, you don't keep it. That's not what I'm saying, that's what she's saying. This is my piece. I love this piece. Vince, she's only one voice. Yeah, well, she's... maybe right. I've been looking for you. Why didn't you tell me? These wonderful people celebrating you and your art. I'm sorry, you are? John Kranski. Who the hell is that guy? I'm his mentor. I was the first to recognize his... extraordinary talent. So, you have some of his pieces, yeah? Oh, I do indeed, plenty of them. His early work, no doubt. - Yeah. - So you have collected his pieces since before... He did his stretch inside? I've owned Vince for a very long time. Mr. K., I was on my way out. You coming? Yeah, if you ever need any body work done on your Spider, give me a call. Vince has my number. Ms. Bloome. Fucking hell, man! "Ex-con... muscles his way into the art world." Nice write-up. I hate it when you hide shit from me. It makes me very, very angry. The two of you get out of here. What the fuck was that back there? I'm selling my stuff. Your stuff? What the fuck are you talking about? That's my stuff. It's mine. It's all mine. Whatever comes out of here in whatever shape it's in, is mine. Listen, I'm just trying to pay you back. All right? All the money I make, and however I make it, it's all yours. You got money and you're keeping it secret from me? That's stealing it from me! All the money is yours. I promise. Yeah... you promise. Of course, you promise. Why wouldn't you promise? You're a crook. I'm an artist. What did you say? You heard me. Yeah, I fucking heard you. You're a thief. Say it. Say you're a thief! I'm an artist. Thief! Artist. Thief... you fuck. Thief! Hey, artist, Jesus Christ... which ear? Huh? What do you mean which ear? Van Gogh! Vincent Van-fucking-Gogh. Left ear, right? Left ear? You're a thief. You're never going to steal from me again. Say it. Say it. I'm an artist! You're a thief! Oh, no...! Turn it off. Larry. Out back in my cassette box, there's money. What I'm really doing, what I'm trying to do is educate you. Yeah, looky, looky. Hey. Take some of that right there. Leave it. Come on. How's the old man going to know if it's short? That's your genius plan? How's he going to know? Yeah. I mean... yeah. Kranski's in there going helter skelter with Vince, who he loves, what do you think he's going to do to you? Come on, man, let's just take a couple of gees. He'll never notice. Just relax, okay. There's going to be a pay day soon with the Mezali deal going down, we got to pick our moment. Yeah, we, uh, got something here, Mr. K. 33,000. 33. And with my cut on the cars, I figure I still owe you 140. That'll square us. Yeah. Untie him. Eww... What's it look like? It looks like a Yorkshire pudding. What's a Yorkshire pudding look like? Look in the mirror, man. Oooh, nasty. My God, what happened to you? Did you get in a fight? Please, come in. Thanks. This might hurt. How did this happen? I dozed off welding. Really? That, uh, Kranski guy is... He's my boss. Well, what was he doing at Julian's? That was just... weird. He wants to share in my success. You did those? Yeah. What do you think? I think they're good. Well, I am just good enough to know that I'm not good enough. Hey... But it's fine. And I like doing it. Anyway, I think really good artists are egocentric assholes. Oh, thanks. And vain enough to think I was talking about you. You all right? Yeah. You know when I was inside, I used to think about when I'd get out, and how I'd do things different. You know, I mean, not do things the same way I used to do them. But here I am, back the way I started. Hey, want to take off and just jump in my car and... start new lives? You'll work as a cashier, I'll work in a factory. And we could live in a trailer park and have, like, six Pomeranians. Those are dogs, right? But, hey, it's not that bad, you know. India chose you to create the centrepiece at Art Frise. Yeah? What's that? It's a big group show next week. Huge artists from all over, including her new discoveries. It's major. I can't. This could take you to a whole new level if... that's what you want. Thanks. You're welcome. I got it all worked out. We fill the order in one night, okay? There's going to be over 100 cars at this event. We can have our pick. We're going to need a bigger crew. We're going to need to move the cars fast, but there's a huge upside. We do this right, they give us the keys, they don't report their cars missing for two, three hours. Yeah, and we can exceed the order. Huh... I-it's... it's perfect. Oh, yeah. How do we take the valet stand? I'll set it up. Yo, I don't know nothing about being no valet, man. Yeah, this is, uh, beneath us. I hate to burst your bubble, guys, but, uh, there's not much beneath us. Yeah, except maybe my dick. This scheme is really something. Thank you. What? The scheme is... I'm just joking. My ear's fine. And by the way, this, it, uh, got my head straight. Good. Yeah. No seriously, Mr. K., thank you. Okay, thank you. You can send this one. Uh-huh, no problem. Kristen told me about this big art show. I want in. What happened to your ear? Burned myself welding. Bullshit! Whatever it is you're into, I want nothing to do with it. I don't get involved with criminals. Oh, I never should have let you fuck me. What? I-I'm working on this new piece. It's a large piece. I think you'll like it. If it sells at this show, it's... it's all yours. This is your last chance. Okay. So is Carl better than Belinda? Come on. No, you come on. I'm a big girl. It didn't mean anything. Oh well, it's really not any of my business. Listen, it was a mistake. I'm done making mistakes. Good for you. Strictly business. Hey. How's it going? Just threw some shit together. It's cover, they won't know the difference. This thing tonight, it'll square us? Yeah. I want you to know, I mean, we should talk in private, in more detail... but I considered it, what you suggested. Thank you. You know, this is... this place, it's, uh... it's kind of a creation, you know? My work, you know, my life. I've been thinking... Me too, a lot. I couldn't entrust this place to anybody else but you. Hey. It's the weirdest feeling. Yeah. Yo, Larry. What? We do him tonight. In the middle of the job? Mmm-hmm. Put a bag over his head, slit his throat, put him in one of the cars. They won't find him till the boat gets to Borat-ville. 'Cause there's no fucking way I'm working for an art fag. So you with me? Yeah, sure, I... I'll back you up. That's good, 'cause I thought I was going to have to do you too. Funny guy. Tracey, two more bottles ! When did this get here? Where the hell is Vince? After all the strings I've pulled for him! What strings? I thought India invited him. Shut up. Go outside and look for him. Look at that. Guys, all right, here are the claim checks. They pull up, you give it to them, all right? You drive the cars around the corner, come back, you do it again. What about the keys? You leave them inside the car. And smile for the nice people, okay? Yeah, act civilized. I'm going to go play artist now. And cute uniforms. Faggot. Oh, hi, there. Get inside, funny man. Sweet. When did you figure us out? Uh, let's see... white van wherever I go, you and me always meeting out somewhere, never in the office. I called Parole Services. They never heard of a Randall Pogue. It's too bad you and your pals will all be in jail tonight. I don't know about that. Really? I've got enough stuff on tape to write a book. Not without my help. 'Cause if I don't go back out there and I tell those guys that everything's cool, this scam is off and you don't get anybody. You know we can make you. Now what are you going to do? Are you going to burn my other ear? So what do you want, Vince? I want what you want. You know, I want to put bad guys in jail. But I want freedom, I want immunity. I mean, whatever you call it... for me. This only works if we get them all, and that includes Kranski. It's time to figure out whose side you're on. Where are you going? I'll see you at the docks. Okay, thanks, guys. Thanks. Thank you. Vince! Oh, fuck. What the hell is going on? Here for my unveiling! I just saw you steal a catering van. What are you doing? You have to trust me. Do I? Yeah. Listen, it's all going to be okay, all right. This is, uh, this is it. This is my way out. Is it legal? Uh... not exactly, but, uh, I know what I'm doing. I know this doesn't make sense to you, but it will. Please, cover for me, okay? Where is he? Every critic in the city is here and they're staring at a fucking tarp. Can't you do anything right? Actually, I can. And don't ever talk to me like that again. Excuse me? I said, don't ever fucking talk to me like that again. Is that clear? Crystal clear. You're fired. Hmm. Hey, man, it's getting late, is that it or what? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got all the cars we need. All right, I'll ride with you then, son. All right, uh, I'll, uh, I'll take this one. All right, all right. Come on, let's go, boys. You know what, Dean? One last car. You take that car. What the fuck? Okay? Come on, Miss Daisy. Hilarious. Vince! Vince! I see him. He must be the last of the cars. We don't move until the money changes hands. So? Hey. What'd I tell you? He's a genius, my boy. It's all in there. You don't have to count it. I'll count it in the car. You guys are good. Oh yeah. Lucky you made it, just in time to leave tonight. We are now a go. I repeat, we are a go. Shit! Get Mezali! Fan out! Find Kranski! Vince, you're supposed to be an ex-criminal, you moron. Ugh! Goddammit! Come here. Oh God! Shut up, shut up! Watch the face. You're that art chick that Vince has been ballin'. Where is he? Come here, I'll show you. Come on, art lady. Put your head down. Hey. Where are you? In some warehouse down by the docks. It's full of steel. Yeah, I'm in... I'm in the same place. Yell out. Hey... Vince, you in here? Belinda? I'm not alone. Nice curves on the lady, son. Wouldn't want to slice any off. Come on, we can share her. Yo, where you at, Vince? Dean, are you nuts? Let her go. Yo, you got the money, boss? Get out of here. Where's the money? Oh! Oh! Ow! - Oh! - Ugh! Get out of here. Go! Right in my ass. Oh, it hurts. You got a gun? Yeah. You haven't had a gun since Korea. It's the same one. Mr. K., don't shoot, it's me. Can you get us out of here? Yeah, yeah, I got a... I got a car. Just wait here, okay, I'll go get it. Larry! No! Son of a bitch! Grab his gun. Mr. K. My leg. I'm bleeding like a stuck pig. Let me see. He hit one... hit one, for Christ sakes. This was you, huh? You're going to be fine. I'm fucked. Oh! This tight enough? Yeah. I had it coming anyway. You got yourself free, kid. You're on your way. Yeah. Vince, the show. Get yourself to the show. Get the hell out of here. Can you walk? No, I can't walk. No, take the briefcase, get me a good lawyer. The best, I promise you. Okay. See you. Sure. He's in here! It's really quite young and vibrant... I don't see it, don't see it, don't... I don't feel anything. 'Cause you're not listening to it. I don't... You have to listen to it, darling. Look, now, it's Vince, Vince. Look, now, he has the style. He's fantastic. Vince is an accident on purpose. This is it, Vince. Hey, um... hello. Thanks for coming. A little while ago, I ran into someone who called me an artist. I didn't even know what the word meant. I'm not quite sure I do now. I'm just a guy off the streets. I just got out of prison. Part of the reason why some of you are interested in me. I never set out to be an artist, I just did what I did for myself. I'd take pieces of metal scrap home, whatever I could find, and I would, uh, I'd go to war with them. I'd fight them, I'd bang them together until they'd turn into something. What, I don't know, but just something. What I did know was that it probably was a better way to spend my time than to steal cars and run away from cops. This last piece, um... I almost didn't make this last piece. I'd made so many compromises that I started to forget what I was doing and who I was doing it for. This is me, without apologies, no secrets, no lies, no compromise. How does a guy like me end up in a place like this? You think about that while you're waiting at the valet for your car, 'cause it might take a while. Enjoy the show. Vince, I... I love... I love this... I love this piece. I don't... I don't want to embarrass you, but I want to have a relationship with this piece. It's really quite good. Thank you. It's going to take a big room. I think... Shouldn't be a problem, Julian. I like it, I like how it moves... I, uh... I wanted to talk about our arrangement. Go on. 60-40. You're already getting 50. 60. And this? No, I've got to give that back. 60-40. It would be setting a ludicrous precedent. Well, you take it or leave it. You've come a long way, Vincent. I've been looking for you. Mr. Pogue, uh, can I get you something, like, uh, champagne, pee in a cup? Where's the money? Kranski? Kranski's fine. He can enjoy a nice long retirement. Seriously? Detective Pogue, Belinda. Belinda, Detective Pogue. Uh, Detective Pogue is here for the briefcase. What briefcase? That briefcase. Oh! That. I'll talk to you later. Sure. I'd like to go over a few things with you, Ms...? Belinda. Ms. Belinda. So what do you think? It's okay. It's okay. So. So? You're going to have to forgive me for all the stupid things I've done. Maybe. You're going to eventually, you know that. Why not now? What about Belinda? This? Oh, I don't know how that got there. You should be more careful with these types of things. I'm going to kiss you now. And then we're going to get the fuck out of here, okay? Pomeranians? As many as you want. Who's the better kisser? Come here, you.
