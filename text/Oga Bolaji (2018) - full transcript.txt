I said the seat has been reserved for someone. -I don't see anyone sitting here, please. -Really? -[in English] It's okay. -[ignition clicks off] [passengers] What’s going on? Why aren’t you moving?

[driver] I've been calling you but you did not hear me. -[Bolaji] I'm sorry. -[indistinct woman chatter] This is the person that the seat is reserved for. [Bolaji] Didn’t you tell her the seat was reserved? -I did not see anyone here. -I told you! Madam, get down so we can leave. [passengers] Madam please get down, what’s your problem? [woman] You guys are lucky. I am in a good mood this morning, otherwise… [driver] You should have stayed. We would have all been stuck here. -[woman]I would have stayed there. -[driver] How are you, bro? [upbeat music playing] [in Pidgin] What’s your day going to be like? As usual we will meet up in the evening. And I will buy the drinks. [laughs] You buy drinks? That’s impossible! That will mean you stumbled on money. No, I did not. Just believe me, I will buy drinks. [driver] It’s okay. [driver] Who is the girl you were talking to at the bus stop? [Bolaji] Which girl? [driver] The young girl selling oranges or are you now a pedophile? -God punish you! -[laughs] -Don’t you get jokes anymore? -Get lost! [laughs] Don’t drive past my stop. What’s it going to be? Tonight as usual? As usual, you know where to find me. I know. We’ll see later then. -All right then. -Salute! [lively afrobeat music playing] Kafilat, morning. Mr. Bolaji, morning. You are getting lighter every day, I’d like to buy your body cream. What’s up? I’m good, you? You’ll buy some beer today, right? Do you trust me now? You know I like to make my own drinks. Your love for freebies won’t kill you! Thank you. [chuckles] Kafilat! Where is my jug? Why would you ask me such a question? [hisses] [whistles] [singing] ♪ Haters ♪ -[whistles] -[lively music playing] [Bolaji chuckles] [in Pidgin] What is wrong with him? [singing] ♪ That’s your business ♪ You are disturbing me. ‪[Bolaji humming a song]‬ The fun has just begun. [chuckles] ‪[Bolaji hums]‬ All right! [humming] Tidy up thoroughly, unlike the other day… [Bolaji] Osas! Osas! [Osas in Edo] What? Osas! [in Pidgin] What is it? You just keep shouting me name. You might as well make the name yours, loudspeaker! You've come to burst my eardrums with your noise. -[Osas] How's it going? -I'm okay. -[Osas] What's up? -Where's my… Where is my stuff? Not I. Go get me my stuff. That’s the reason you’re shouting and disturbing me this early? I’m coming, I’ll go get it for you. Aren’t you going to work today? Brother, I’ll go. I just want to have a bath. -Okay. -[Osas yawns] ‪[mumbles] Let me drop this thing.‬ [whistles] Hmm, too much. [Bolaji clears throat] Now I feel fresh. I’m coming, I’ll go get that stuff. Was that a bath? [sarcastically] No, I didn’t. If that’s how humans bathe, wouldn’t people be long dead by now? Are you crazy? Well, I've been bathing this way. Am I dead yet? Please, I’m going to wear my uniform. I'll get your stuff for you right away. Just wait. If you don’t bathe today, you’d be dead by tomorrow. [Osas] See how you look, you’re the dead one! -Same to you. -[Osas hisses] -[chuckles] -[Osas] You just came here to shout at me. [mimics Bolaji's words] Trying to… You can’t insult me in my own house. Not possible. Not even possible. Don't try it. That’s your food. Thank you. I’m leaving for work. [singing along to music on headphones] [in Pidgin] Honestly, some Nigerians are not smart, I tell you. Okay, so you’ve hit it big, why don’t you show Nigeria some love? Instead you buy clothes, shoes and food from foreign countries. -[driver] Mr. Bolaji, food? -[Osas] Food? Yes, food! I tell you Some Nigerians aren’t sensible. But what about the ones who don’t want Nigeria to grow? The ones who produce fake product? Did you forget about them? As long as the products are Nigerian, gradually we would improve our industries, Nigeria will grow. Look, let me tell you, If you buy products made in Nigeria, the money is paid to a Nigerian. That Nigerian spends the money and gives another Nigerian. The other puts it in a bank and the money then builds up interest. As the money grows, we build Nigeria, and the country grows. This way the money circulates amongst Nigerians. But when you use our money to buy products from foreigners, you help their own industries, economy and people grow. So buy made-in-Nigerian goods! That’s my point! Mr. Bolaji, the drink is finished. Really? Well, if that’s the case, then there’s only one thing left. -Home! -[driver] Home! That’s fine, I’m already home. We’d see tomorrow, yeah? [driver in English] Yeah, definitely. Please remember to have a bath tomorrow. You’re one of the people spoiling Nigeria. -Mr. Bolaji, -Hmm? [Bolaji] What? You're stupid. -[Bolaji] Same to you. -Get lost! [driver] He does not bathe? [Bolaji] Yes, he doesn’t. [driver] No wonder my cigarette smells like insect repellent. [driver laughs] [Bolaji] Okay brother, see you tomorrow. -[driver] Okay, later. -All right, then. [food vendor in Yoruba] It’s hot and it’s spicy! [Bolaji] Mama T!

Wasn’t it just now you arrived? Don’t you want it to be hot? You know me, I like it as hot as the sun. [chuckles] [mama T] Give him the ones that are very hot. [assistant] Okay. [Bolaji whistles] [Bolaji] Put extra, put extra! -Mr. Bolaji. -[Bolaji] Yes? [in Yoruba] What exactly is the problem? [in Pidgin] What's going on? [in Pidgin] I'm giving you free puff-puff and you're asking for extra? Mama T, why are speaking that way? Don’t I bring paper for you? [mama T] What do you mean, paper? How much is the paper? [Bolaji] Please I’m leaving. [mama T] That’s your business. If you’re leaving, leave. -We’ll see tomorrow. -[mama T] All right. Mama T. [in Pidgin] I’m leaving for the place we discussed earlier. [mama T] See you tomorrow. [in English] No, I'll still come back this night. -[mama T in pidgin] Alright… Be safe. -Okay [mama T in Yoruba] Fool, he wants to put me in debt. He never pays for his puff puff. [gentle music playing] [in Pidgin] The fare is 100 naira. What? The fare is 100 naira. To where? To heaven? To Mushin, of course. Sir, why would the transport fare to Mushin be 100 naira? Since when? It's not my first time of going to Mushin. Madam, aren’t you aware of the fuel price increase? Why are you mad at me? Be mad at the people who increased the price of fuel. What increase? The price has been reduced. And it’s because I spoke up! Why are you looking at me that way? Don’t look at me Focus on the road so we don’t have an accident. Don’t look at me! Madam, you’re giving me too much trouble. I’m not. Just pay the money, please. I didn’t say I won’t pay the money. I’ll pay, but not the price you asked for. Everyone knows the transport fare to Mushin. Even in Lekki and Ikoyi, they all know the fare price to Mushin. [laughs] This woman, you’re funny. -You're funny, too. -You're really funny. Brother, aren’t you listening to her? Seeing as I look stressed, aren’t you supposed to give me a free ride today? And then next time I ride, I’ll pay. Especially because I'm like a sister to you in this Nigeria. Nigeria is hard. Sir, I'll find your change when I get to the junction. This country has been hard for a while now. Leave me. I’ll give you the 50 naira. I can't give you 100 naira. If I don’t, will you beat me? Is it my money you’ll use to build a house in your village?

[in English] Thank you. [saxophone solo playing] [in Pidgin] Seems like you don’t want to go to work today. You wasted my time at the bus stop. Now you’re seated like a CEO, spreading yourself all over like a virus. Is it because I always pick you up? [in Pidgin] You want to start with this your tantrums this morning? I was looking at someone and you just got in my way. What do you mean, I got in the way? Are you-- -[passenger1] Driver, will be sleep here? -[passenger2] I wonder. Let's go. You guys should calm down. [passenger1 in English ] Move this! Why are you rushing as if you just got a new car engine? Calm down! Aren’t we moving already? Don't give me trouble. [upbeat music playing] The reason you wasted my time was because you were looking at a woman, right? Omoh, what's wrong with you? If you had seen the pretty woman I saw… She is so beautiful and you just got in the way. The girl is so beautiful? I hope you weren't looking at the little girl who sells oranges. Are you crazy? You are the crazy one. Why would I do that sort of thing? I was looking at the woman the girl met before you blocked my view. Leave me alone, you’re not sensible. [Omoh laughs] You get angry easily. What’s up? How is it going to be this evening? Would it be the usual? Yes, the usual. I was thinking I’d buy some suya so we’d enjoy the beer better. -Very true! -[laughs] You’re just awesome. You too. [laughs] No worries. Bolaji, wait. What is it? Are you sure you were looking at a woman this morning, or you now do little girls? Omoh! God punish you. -[in English] Same to you.

Who are you angry at? -I'm not fighting. -[mama T] Just because of an extra one? -I thought you were giving him free. Should I put one extra? Add one more for him. [mama T] Why are acting like a hungry man? I don’t get it. -[mama T] My sister… -Do you want a nylon bag? -Give me! -Okay. That was the reason she left Ghana. Her husband died in Ghana and so she came back to Nigeria because she’s a citizen here. She takes up little jobs here and there to take care of herself. Like cleaning, washing plates, washing clothes, and stuff like that. -Mama T, this isn’t enough. -[mama T] It’s not enough? It’s not, let her put another extra.

God will bless you. Amen. Don’t worry, you mother won’t be angry, okay? I’m leaving now. Don’t forget. Come to Paradise bar near Olude market okay? Bye-bye! [afrobeat music playing] Omoh, what’s up? Please I need a favor from you. And I don’t want you to say no. You haven’t asked for what you want but you want me to say yes. What if you ask me to go murder someone? Why would I ask that? What is wrong with you? Okay. What do you want to ask? [Bolaji] Please I need you to lend me 350 naira. Why are you staring at me? I know you have the money. How do you know that? Am I some sort of bank? So I should go to a bank to borrow 350 naira? Don’t you earn salary? Use it. It’s not the end of the month yet, that’s why I asked you. If it were, I wouldn’t have asked. [Omoh] What do you need the money for? [Bolaji] Really? If I don’t tell you, you won’t give me 350 naira? -I won’t. -Forget it! Please move, the road is now free. ‪[car engine starts]‬ [lively music playing] And you call yourself my friend. What’s up? Would you lend me the money or not? [hisses] Bolaji! [in Pidgin] When would you pay me back? I told you, at the end of the month when my salary is paid. I’m asking because I know you are lazy. If you don’t pay back I swear, I’ll never pick you up again. -Cool off, man! -[laughs] I don’t blame you. I’ve given you the money so you can now talk back. [Bolaji teasing] Omoh-ski! ‪[afrobeat music playing]‬ ‪-[afrobeat music continues]‬ ‪-[inaudible]‬ [in Pidgin] Why are you running like a thief? You stole something? [in Pidgin] You are foolish! I know that’s what you do every morning. Mr. Bolaji, you’re sick. [laughs] Didn’t you know that already? Don’t pour out any drink. Why? Why would you tell me that? Try to stop me! Must you take things for free every day? Can’t you just pay for your beer? Be like your mates. Man up and buy your beer. Do you know what your mates do? Buy beer for me then. [mimicking] Buy beer! [whistling] I feel pity for those who work with you. If they’re not careful, they'll die soon. -Mr. Bolaji? -What? [in Pidgin] Why would you utter such nonsense? It’s you who will die soon. -Take this. -Oh. Oh. I’m leaving. This is my dinner. Awesome. [mobile phone ringing] [in Yoruba] Who is it now? Hello Omoh, what’s up? Your bus broke down? Where? That means you’d be here early. Okay, no worries. Of course! I’ll supply the drinks, as usual. [laughs] Okay. [upbeat afrobeat music playin] ‪[humming]‬ [in Pidgin] So where are all the hawkers you spoke about today? I told you consistently not to come here but you refused. That’s my problem with you, you never listen. Wait…wait! What Is wrong with guys? Why are you acting like an amateur government official? [man] Start the bus Calm down! You all are impatient. Guys look, just be vigilant. We’ve been vigilant since we got here, we've not seen anyone. -Cool down. They'll show up soon. -[man] We've been here for a while. Didn’t I tell you guys? [man1] Look, here they come. ‪[tense music playing]‬ [afrobeat music playing] [man1] But why is she frowning? That’s true. Madam, look. Thank God it’s your lucky day, or else we’d have arrested you with your goods. And you know what? You’d face the court of law. You've all been warned by the government not to hawk on the streets. They don’t listen. But you've refused to heed simple instructions. Look around, look how dirty this place is! -Do you like it? -Do you like it? Today is your last warning We don't want to see you at… [phone rings] Who is this? [man 2] The lady we saw yesterday is already calling you. [man 2 laughs] -[man 2] You love to have fun! -[man 3] He loves women more than work. Hello? [man 3] You should see the lady I am talking about. [man 1] Hello? [man 2] I'm the only one who knows where he saves his money. [man 1] What did you say? [in English] Where? Olude market. [afrobeat music playing] [Omoh] But Osas, why don’t you bathe? ‪[sniggers]‬ [Bolaji] Why are you staring at me? Answer the question! -[Bolaji laughs] -Look at his face. -[Bolaji] Dirty person! -[laughs] -[softly] I know you're the person. -[Omoh laughs] -Can you smell something? -What's the matter? -Don’t contaminate my drink! [laughs] -What? -Hold on, bring the drink. -[Bolaji and Omo laugh] -Let me… -Are you crazy? -Shameless! What?! -[laughs] This country is not moving forward at all. The same news every day, poor people, poor people. Next thing, workers are on strike. Tomorrow, another strike. What’s the reason? They are not paying salaries. What’s all this nonsense about? Very true. Go online, check Facebook. Check it now. You will see stories about countries producing young millionaires. But in Nigeria, the only thing we produce is poor people. [Bolaji] Poor people! [Osas] Wait! I have a question to ask. The poor people you are talking about, are you not one of them? [Osas] How much do you have in your account? [Osas] Why are you staring away? Am I lying? The three of us are part of the poor people in this country. And that’s the reason. No no, it is because there are no jobs. That's why we are poor. Not just lack of jobs. Schools, too. Mr. Bolaji wants to brags again. You are the most educated of us all. I am not bragging. Think about it. Do you how many good schools are there in America? But here they don’t pay the teachers, they don’t pay the professors. But how many good schools do they have in foreign countries? If you want to get a job here, you must have schooled in a foreign country before you can get a job. Yes that’s why I like you. You're my friend because you always speaks the truth. If you start looking for a job in Nigeria with a Nigeria BSc, you won’t get the job. But if you go the company with a BSc from a foreign country, even if it is a country where blacks are suffering, the company will make you the manager right away, Students don’t even want to go to school anymore. It’s only music and internet they want to do and it’s not like they can sing. They are all singing nonsense. Meanwhile do you know how many CDs I've taken to producers so they can support me? But no they don’t. The only thing we need right now in this country is God. [Bolaji protests] Don’t bring churches into this matter. because they -are just the worse. -How? -[Omoh] Really? How? -How? Don’t be ignorant. [upbeat music playing] ‪[tense music playing]‬ [little girl whimpering] Jesus, no, no! [in Pidgin] Didn’t you hear the M-force alarm? Why didn’t you run? You just stood there looking like a fool. Are you mute? Auntie, my oranges. You have to wait for M-force to leave the scene before you can go to pack your oranges. [Bolaji] This country’s situation is frustrating. If you take it to heart, it will put you in your grave. Wait, I told one little girl to come see me here and she hasn’t showed up. Ah! Why are you surprised? Bolaji, is it that little girl you talk to at the bus stop every day? I have been warning you. That girl is too young for you. You can’t date her! Who is the girl? [laughs] And he keeps telling me I don’t bathe. -Your case is different. -[Osas] How old? How old is that girl anyway? I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to get arrested. Ask him. I have been warning him for some time. It's when he is sent to jail, that’s when he'll heed to my warning. Does one beg shit to stink? [laughs] Leave him. Let him do as he likes with the girl. He will know the Nigeria police force is efficient when they want to be. Leave him. It’s in prison he will get a producer to make his record. [both laugh] Please quickly get beer for us. What beer? The beer is finished. [soft instrumental music playing] Okay, okay, you can go now. The mad M-force men are gone. Okay go now. Move, move! [tense fast-paced music playing] [newscaster] Thank you for staying with us. More update on yesterday's incident. A young girl named Ajua was killed when a bike rider hit her while trying to flee from market regulator inspectors AKA M-force. M-force was set up to tackle street trading and hawking on busy roads. The incident happened in the evening between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. at Olude market. More updates to come. The Joint Admission and Matriculation… You killed someone? What nonsense are you saying? [newscaster] …story of a snake swallowing 36 million naira from one of the… [mom] Are you going to church? Don’t worry. I'll come and meet you there. [chuckles] [in Yoruba] Idle man. [newscaster] An account clerk in the office is currently answering the queries. [slow afrobeat music playing] [Bolaji] Mama T! Mama T! Mama T. ‪[man] Oh, what a shame.‬ Sorry. [in Pidgin] Don’t be angry, I did not see you coming. Brother, please excuse me. Sorry again, I heard people crying, why? One woman’s child died around Olude market. Die? Oh, what happened? They said one bike rider hit the little girl. The M-force officers were rounding up people selling goods by the road side and people hawking goods too. So the little girl carried her oranges and started heading home when one bike rider being chased by the M-force officers charged at her and hit the little girl. The little girl fell to the ground, dead on impact. When did this happen? Not long ago, maybe yesterday. It was yesterday. The girl’s mother has been crying all day. Only God can console her. Yes, only God can console her. Did you come to see the mother? [Bolaji] No I don’t know them. I came to see Mama T. [man] Don’t you know today is Sunday? Mama T doesn’t sell on Sundays. [Bolaji] Thank you, brother. Thank you. [man] Don't worry, Stay safe. ‪[Bolaji hisses] [heaves heavy sigh]‬ [indistinct chatter] Give me a beer. [in Pidgin] Please, let me call you back. [sighs] Mr. Bolaji, why are you frowning? We both know you don’t pay for your beer. What happened today? Kafilat, give me beer! [ethereal voices singing] Stop staring at me. -You asked for… [voice fades] -[ethereal voices continue singing] Mr. Bolaji, what is wrong? You've been like this since you came. What happened? Mr. Bolaji! [upbeat music playing] I am really tired [whistles] Man, I'm tired. Really tired. What’s all this nonsense? Go to the market to buy your own cotton wool and methylated spirit. [in Edo] This is a miracle. Mr. Bolaji. You always mock me that I don’t bathe. Why are you not taking a bath and using your perfume? Don't leave that thing there! I don’t know what’s going on in your head. Kafilat told me that you have been acting like you murdered someone. Look at you, just [splutters] messing up my home. Messing it like… I can't understand it this morning. Take! You just came to my house. You are not even polite enough to greet me. Look at his head, -[phone rings] -like a wooden ladle! [hisses] -[mom] Bolaji! -[Bolaji] Ma! [Bolaji] Mama T! Mama T! [Mama T in Pidgin] What is it? [Bolaji] Mama T, yes. -[mama T] Hello. -[Bolaji] Hello. [in Pidgin] Why are you shouting my name? [Bolaji] I'm sorry. I brought newspapers for you. Thank you. But you know I start cooking in the evening. I'm not here to see you. [mama T] Who did you come to see? Victoria lives here, right? How do you know Victoria? Mr. Bolaji, Victoria is a decent lady. Mama T, I know. [mama T] How do you know? I heard she lost her daughter, so I came to see her. That’s true. But how you you know her daughter? A colleague at work told me about the incident and he directed me here. Where can I find her? I don’t believe what you're saying. But it’s true. Are you sure you came to console her and nothing else? The reason I am here is to console her. Go that way. Okay. I will come for my puff puff in the evening. I have heard you. [melancholic music playing] [Kafilat] Mr. Bolajia, what's all this nonsense? What do you mean, nonsense? If you want me to do your job, then I should be paid your salary, Please don’t be angry. I was ill yesterday, that’s the reason. You? Sick? Yes. But you bought a bottle of beer yesterday. The beer was for the sickness. It was sickness of the mind, not the body. [laughs] Mr. Bolaji. You are crazy. Get out of my way and leave me alone. Your family is crazy. [expresses surprise] Is this guy crazy? [percussion music playing] Where are you going? [Bolaji] Mama T! -[Mama T] Mr. Bolaji. -I've come back. That was fast! -What can I say? -You're back so fast! You know I don’t play with my stomach. I am aware. -My good friend! -That's right! -Sit down. -Okay now. -Really? -[Bolaji] That's right. -This is a lot. -Right? Don’t worry, I will whip up a special dough just for you. -[laughs] -Really? So you're just noticing that I am a special person. You are a special person. [laughs] Okay, I will wait. -[Bolaji] Let me learn how you do it. -Yes. [gentle urban music playing] -[mama T] Do you like it? -[Bolaji] Yes. I told you so! I'm cooking something special for you today. -Hmm. Mama T! -Yes, I'm the super cook. ‪-[laughs]‬ ‪-It's nothing new.‬ -Very true. -Been doing this for a while. -Mr. Bolaji, -Hmm how come you're here early today? Is there a problem? I want to talk to you about something. Okay. What is happening to the lady who lost her child? -Victoria? -[Bolaji] Yes. ‪[scoffs][hisses]‬ -My brother, her life has changed. -Huh? She is very sad. She's so sad. She does not eat. She has stopped working. I have tried to console her but she does not say a word. It is a terrible thing to lose a child. -What a shame! -Oh, she's very sad. But Mr. Bolaji, your mother is not a poor woman. Talk to her, so Victoria can come work for her at your house. Your mother can pay her small wages. It will be good for a start. Or what do you think? I'm not sure my mother can afford that. But I can help her look for a job. -Mr. Bolaji, you will be blessed. -[Bolaji] Amen. -You will be blessed. -[Bolaji] Amen. Anything you touch will prosper in Jesus's name. Amen! -You are a good man. -I always try my best. -God bless you. -Thank you. -I’ll give you another one. -Hmm! ‪When you eat it, you will love it!‬ -Mama T! -Yes, that’s me. -[Bolaji] Mama T! -Yes, that’s me. [yelps, groans] What is wrong? Why are you acting weak? Are you not a man? So I should burn my skin because I’m a man? Stop it, you can’t get hurt. -Mama T! -[mama T] Yes, that’s me. -Mama T! -[mama T]Yes, that’s me. [afrobeat music playing] [Omoh] What's up? I'm all right. Where is my money? I told you I'd pay you back. Calm down. I have not seen you for two days. Where is my money? I already told you I was going to pay back I was a bit ill. [Omoh] Sickness has nothing to do with money. When will you pay? Cool down. I will pay your money by the end of the month. Get in, let’s go. [gentle afrobeat music] [man] Wow, Mr. Bolaji. Sir? Mr. Manager. [in Pidgin] What's the problem? Nothing. I just came to ask for a small favor. What kind of favour? Um… Why are you turning your neck? Is something wrong with it? No, no no sir. No, no manager. Please, I want to ask you for… What do you want to ask? [Bolaji] Please, Mr, Manager, I need you to help a friend of mine. [manager in English] And why would I do that? [Bolaji] She lost her child last week. So I was thinking maybe if she got a small job here, it could help her with her loss. -[manager] Small work? -[Bolaji] Yes. [maanager in English]There is no such thing available for now. [Bolaji] Okay, Mr. Manager. Sir, what if my friend and I take turns in clearing the tables, then at the end of the month, we split the salary. This friend of yours, is she your girlfriend? Mr. Manager, [laughing] she is not my girlfriend. I don't understand your desperation with this friend of yours. I told you she lost her daughter. Since then, she's stopped eating or… I thought getting a job here could help her become herself again. [in Pidgin] Can you share you salary with her? [in English] Why not? Yes. Okay, I will think about it. My boss! Thank you very much, sir. I said I will think about it. I am thanking you in advance for thinking about it. My boss!

[Bolaji laughs in assent] -You got a job for her? -Yes I did. Your mother agreed? No, not my mother. I told my manager at work. He agreed to let her work with us. -Mr. Bolaji, God bless you. -Amen. -God will solve all your problems. -Amen. ‪-In Jesus's name.‬ ‪-Amen.‬ -Thank you so very much, my brother. -Thank God.
