The War was over... The only survivors were street animals: dogs, cats and rats. From them, a new race of mutants evolved. That was a long time ago. Mok, a legendary superrocker, has retired to Ohmtown. There his computers work at deciphering an ancient code which would unlock a doorway between this world and another dimension Obsessed with his dark experiment, Mok himself searches or the last crucial component... a very special voice. Whew, home at last! We've seen every new singer in the whole country. Hey, did the boss find the voice for his new act? Nah, and he ain't gonna, cause there's no place left to look. Toad? Yeah? One more show, in town. But boss... Now! I'll get the car. Computer, report. Your record sales are dropping. A confidential analysis shows a downward trend in popularity... Enough! that could result.... Stop! Not you stupid, drive on. Downward trend in popularity. Hmph. Computer, report on our ...project. Progress on this project unchanged. Show me the Armageddon Key. Have you finished decoding it? Decoding not yet complete Mok. I see. Most recent calculations show you will still need a living voice The vibrations from this voice will create the doorway through which the being will enter this dimension. The ring I designed will identify the exact voice frequency you will require. Yes yes, thank you. You're welcome Mok. That one voice will bring me a powerful being from another dimension. A scientific breakthrough for me; an unforgettable magic show for the masses. You really have a way with words Omar. Hey, I'm rehearsing. So we play one song. One of your songs, of course. Of course. So if we did two songs, one could be mine. ...yeah ...yeah, okay. Omar! yeah Angel? - I'm gonna trust you. - Yeah, you trust everybody. Where's Dizzy and Stretch? You cannot defend your planet alone. Prepare to die Space Cadet. C'mon Stretch, We're on in five. No, nyet! Not yet Diz. I gotta unwind! Look out! You've got company at twelve o'clock. ?????? ?????! But the house is such a mess!

C'mon Stretch, snap out of it. Okay, but I'm still not relaxed. You'll be okay, you're just nervous. Take a deep breath. Hey, it worked! I'm not nervous, I'm scared. Fabuloso! Thanks guys, I too love the sound of cats in boiling water. Okay, now, join me Mylar in welcoming tonight's last act! # Don't need you, I don't live in this town # Don't trust you, don't want you standing around # Don't want you, ain't gonna stick around # I wasn't born for loving # I was born to raise Hell # I wasn't born for loving # I was born to raise Hell # I hate you, and I hate this town # I mean you, and this awful town, # I mean you, you just make me laugh # I wasn't born for loving # I was born to raise Hell # I wasn't born for loving # I was born to raise Hell # I hate you do you like me? # No! # ???? ???????? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ? ???? # No! # It's such a pity you want me to go # Go! # You're so pretty, you're so pretty. You're so fair, love your hair. # You're so pretty, you're so pretty. Love your makeup, love your nose. # Love your eyes. Love your clothes. # You're PRETTY USELESS! # I hate you, and I hate this town. # I mean you... # ... don't need you, I don't live in this town, don't trust you... Someone cut the power? What happened? We didn't even finish! Give me just one good reason why you guys should finish. How about this? Okay, that's one good reason. Chop chop, same song. Omar, MY song! And now, back by popular demand, tonight's last act. # Oh what will the signal be For your eyes to see me. # Watching outside as I wait, just in case you need me. # So I still will set the stage, send my thoughts to you. # I'm receiving every wave, this song sends love through. Mok, right? I'm one of your biggest fans! Welcome to Mylar's! The launching pad, or the stars! Easy on the polyesters, guy! # Oh what will the signal be For your eyes to see me. So uh, what's going down, I mean this wouldn't have anything to do with your world-wide talent search, would it? Okay okay, so it's hush hush, I don't know anything, except... I might just have a band... that could make us both a bundle. ...a tidy sum? ...a couple of bucks? Heeey! I didn't say it was THIS band, did I? Now I have revealed exactly why I'm here, I'll be your angel if you want to see how perfect sharing love with an angel can be. Like I said, this band's on it's way to fame and fortune. All right! I loved it! And so did a warm personal and influential friend of mine. The only Ohmtown rocker to have a record go gold, platinum and plutonium in one day! Um... Don't tell me... um, um, who? Mok, the Magic Man! Mok? Don't let him get us! He'll put a heck on me! Hex, Stretch, hex. Ooo, two of them, that's even worse! Hey guys, I'm gonna work up your promo, so which one's your lead singer? - Omar. - Angel. - Angel. - Omar. A duo? Fabuloso! Old fashioned but new! I love it! Where'd Angel go? I dunno. She left. So, uh, listen Omar, have you ever thought about, well, about singing with Angel? Yeah Omar. You know, two lungs are better than one, right? You see Omar, Mr. Mylar was a little confused about who our lead singer is... Yeah, and Dizzy? Okay, okay, I'm getting the idea. I may be stubborn but I'm not stupid. Come on, Omar, I think if you and Angel ever got together, someday we could be as big as Mok. Screw Mok. Omar, don't talk like that! Mok is everywhere! M-M-Mok knows everything. It's Mok! No, it's not, it's only officer Quadhole. Crazy cop. Hey you guys, you were great tonight. See ya later. ??????, ?????? ?? ?? ???????? ???? ? ?????? You've already screwed things up for one night. I trusted you, you jerk... Nice talk. I came to tell you.. You were good! You were good! So why'd you walk? Hey you know, everything got a little weird. Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't know Angel. I guess I just want it all, now. I want everything too, Omar. It takes time. Miss Angel? Hey you sleazy pervo, I'm gonna... A message for Miss Angel. Omar, forget him, look at this. Won't you come up for a spell? Cute. Forget it. Come on! O, he wants to talk to us. It could be big fun. I thought you weren't coming up to Mok's, Omar. I changed my mind. Welcome to the modest house of Mok! Omar, you haven't even met the guy. Don't have to, I've seen his magic act. If I didn't know you better, Omar, I'd say you were jealous. Get serious. I guess you're not coming in? I guess you're right. Shoot yourself. How do you get in? M-m-m-maybe you gotta sacrifice a goat or something. Ooo! Yeah? W-we're here t-to see Mok... Mok! Great to see ya! he heh, but eh Nice place you got here. Kinda cozy. Ah thanks uh, but... Mok, baby, let's talk some vinyl, what's the deal? Eh, listen, you got it all wrong, I'm not... oof! Oh, hi! You must be Mok's brother. No, but... uh No? But you look so much alike. Duh, well uh we are brothers, but? uh Like I said, let's bottom line it Mok! I'M NOT MOK !!! You're not? No. Sorry. Mok! Great to see ya! Did you tell him I was Mok? No. Then why does he keep calling me Mok? Are you calling me a liar? No, but he keeps calling me Mok. - You are calling me a liar. - I am... not. ...... That's it, party's over. ???????????. Slow down Omar, now let's give it a chance? Come on, it's a waste of time to creep around this depravo's? ...mansion escorted by two of mother nature's finest freaks. -Three... -Huh? Three! This one talks in numbers. Words to the wise, guy. Be nice, or be dog food. Follow? Make yourselves at home. Except you. It was the freak reference, wasn't it? You gonna apologize, rude boy? - I'm sorry... dogbreath! - What you..?! Anyone want a beer? I'm Mok. Hi. - Am Not! - Am so! ahem! Allow me to introduce the Rollerskating Schlepper Brothers: Toad, Sleazy and Zip. Mes assistants stupide. I just love it when he talks French... ooof! Ah, sweet Angel. You look more beautiful in person, than you do onstage. Better get some antiseptic on that before it festers. Well, uh, that's Omar, our ????????? and... And this... Enough about them, let's talk about you. What did you think of my last album? I loved it! I bought it too. My gerbil uses it for a room divider. But where's our hospitality? Boys! Bring on the Edison Balls. I'm sure you're into reaching new levels of consciousness, aren't you? Yeah, we're into that kinda stuff. It's all we ever do. Excellent. Then I've got something you boys will really enjoy. Shall we take a stroll in the garden, my dear? Here, wiseguy. Ooo. Uh, not for me, I've had one today, and uh... Catch! Where's the fat one? Fat one? Hmph. I don't like this. Angel? ...Angel? So, uh, how many rooms you crammed into here? Success does have it's rewards, Angel. However, such trophies are minor compared to what I really want. Okay on number three; fade up on the girl. An audience which and understand the power of magic. My magic. Is that too much to ask? No, but? Apparently, it is. You must remember that my last concert was not entirely sold out. So? It was still great. I was there! Don't toy with me, Angel. I'll show them power. I can do it! With you, Angel, and your voice. What about the rest of the band? My contract has room for only one signature: yours. The group's just starting to come together. I think we've got a pretty good chance of? Vegitating on the Ohmtown circuit for the rest of your life. Call it what you want! I believe in? Miracles? If you think you're going anywhere with the Omars of this world... Open your eyes! Accept my offer. No Mok. I couldn't leave them for anything. I didn't offer you anything; I offer you EVERYTHING! NO! Too bad. But we all have our illusions, far be it for me to take away yours. Hey, she's picking it up. Yeah, the boss was right. Come on, Come on, the boss it waiting! Toad. You will bring me my demon, Angel, whether you like it or not. Show her friends to the door. Angel? Angel? We have to go. Oh no. I spy with my little eye something that begins with... ...Fat! I was looking for you. What's going on? I demand an answer! Hey you know, you're a pretty nosy guy. Violence is not the answer to anything. Can't we discuss this civilized human beings? Nope, I don't think so. Look Sleazy. These ones are still watching old holograms I think their brains have seized up! Triumph! Triumph to the glory! Triumph of the glory of me! Aww, lookit Toad, now they're sleeping like little babies. Everyone outta the pool! But Toad, they can't walk in this condition. Yeah, you're right Sleazy. I think they better drive. Excuse me, but could you put me down? Hello? Hello? Is anyone in there? Ouch! Oh, so you wanna play rough eh? That's what I was afraid of. These hands are lethal weapons. I could paralyze you. Oh no you couldn't. Remember, violence is not the answer to anything. Hey Toad, this one's got lethal weapons. Whoa! Keep him away from me! You skinheads don't scare me! Omar! Stretch! Where's Angel? What have you done with her? We didn't do nuthin'. She's goin to Nuke-York with Mok. She what? She's gonna be a big star. Mok's gonna make her a big star! She was, uh, overwhelmed.

You're welcome... SLIIIIIIIIME! # Goin down the road, with a friend or two # Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do # You thought you seen it all, you ain't seen nothing new # There ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do # I can read and write, I'm a rock and roller # And I can't control myself # Big city, big lights, can see it up ahead # ????? Nobody can stop me, I'm driving ahead # Make a name for myself, and I'll be number one # Then I'll turn around, and turn around, and laugh at everyone # I can read and write, I'm a rock and roller # And I can't control myself. # I can read and write, I'm a rock and roller # And I can't control myself. ????????! ????? ?? ???????? "???????? ????". Nuke York's not ready for us yet. Just remember Omar, it's not Ohmtown. It's Nuke-York, Hold on to your privates, generals, we're going through. Halt! Hey buddy, power black out. City's closed. No admittance to unauthorized vehicular traffic. Chief Inspector Quaalude, Ohmtown Police, these are scientists, big shots. Sorry Inspector, there's trouble inside and it's my job to? That's great. You're doing a good job. We'll be on our way. Thank's anyways, Inspector I'll just check this... Hey, this is a tuna fishing license! Just how long does Mok think he can keep me here? Picnic time for little girls... This is what I think of your picnic. Ooo! Okay, that's it, you're gonna stay here for a long time! Keep your flippers off me! Yeah, yeah, maybe even longer! Stuff it, pinheads! You got it sister! Cinderella knows what you're talking about! Sometimes those brothers of mine really burn my buns too. They keep this place locked up tighter than a hummingbird's tweet. By the way doll, who're you? Mok's new ladyfriend? Mok's new ladyfriend? Yeah, I guess so but, uh, hey, it don't make life any easier. Cinderella knows what you're talking about. They just don't understand us new women. all, every now and then a girl's gotta get out and dance, catch my drift? Gotcha, doll. Hey, if you're talking about walking, what's the scoop? No sweat! I just slide down the chute and away I scoot! I do it every Saturday night! Let's go! I have to be back in bed by twelve o'clock. That's when Toad checks in on me. Aw, that's too bad toots, but nevermind. With your funk and my spunk, we don't need much time to find some real hot action! Hey, you're a little dated for one of Mok's, you know what I mean? But that's okay. Just keep your lips zipped and stick with Cindy. We're on our way to the Twilight Zone! Y'know, it's just like Toad says: 'There's wackos out there just waiting for a for sweet young things like you.' So let's go for it! I've found the voice. I've got the girl. Understood. The Armageddon Key has now been fully decoded. Stand by for data transmission. According to the Key,? ?the girl must sing this progression of musical notes. The vibrations of her voice will create a doorway through which this being will enter this dimension. Ah yes. My beast; their nightmare. All mine, for a song! And then, nothing can stop me! Tough shape, Mok. You can be stopped. There is a force which can send the being back. Send it back? What? Where? Who? The being can be sent back by the magic of one voice, one heart, one song. Magic? Magic, shmagic! "One voice, one heart, one song," ?gibberish, garbage! Who is this person? Individual's identity presently unavailable. Search will start now. Now checking, now checking, now checking... Grrr. Who can stop me? Is it the girl? You bumming out on me? No way. Okay then, let's get out of here before we get caught. According to the Key, the being can be sent back by the magic... I know, I know, "one voice one heart one song", but WHO is it? No one. No one can send it back. No one? No such person? Then the beast is mine! PROMOTION: Raising a real demon could be real bad for your image. ACCOUNTING: Think of the possible damage to sales from famine, pestilence and etcetera. LEGAL: ...cost would be enormous. We all realize business is a tiny bit off but. I mean this is pretty crazy... Wars have been started for less! When I want your opinions. I'll give them to you. Whoooa... oof! We're in the clear. Come on doll, let's score a cab! Right behind ya ...heh. ????????, ??????????? 68, ???-?? ???, ? ? ??? ? ?????? 98 ? ????????? ?????, ?? ???????? ?????? ???????? ???? ?? ??????? ?? ???? ??????: ??? ????????? ???????????? ?? ??????????????? ????? ??????????? ???????-??????? ? ??????? ????! ?????? ? ??????? ? ??????? ?? ??? ???????????? ??????? "????????? ? ????????". "??? ??? ????????? ??? ?????" AHH! OOO! EAAH!! ...oh, I can't look! Oh yeah, the ladies will love this. Okay, Alphonse. Alphonse? Ooo! So that's you're real name. Dry up, Stretch. Ooo, touchy! Let's see if I got the whole story. Oscar here piles everyone into a stolen police car, beats it up to Nuke-York, tries to run the barricades, you all get busted by the city cops, and I havefta close down shop for half a day to bail you all out. It's not exactly as it sounds, Aunt Edith. We're a band, right? And Angel left without telling anybody, and we just... Oscar says she owes us a personal explanation. For what? Because she ran off with Mok, without saying goodbye? Cause he's a big star and you guys are just wishing? We're concerned. Say what? I said we're concerned. Concerned about who? About Angel, we're concerned about her, okay?! You're all heart, Oscar. You never told us we're concerned. Is it some sort of proof there? Oh yeah, if it gives you any trouble, come on back. Okay guys, I can't tell you much about Mok, but I can tell you about Cinderella. Aw, are you gonna tuck us in, too? Relax Oscar, I was just beginning to like ya, ya little scumbag. Like I was saying, she's the little sister of a couple of guys who work for Mok. Toad, Zeazy and Slip? Yeah, close. So where will we find her? I know she hangs around an uptown club. What does she look like? Sorry Alphonse, everyone looks the same through this thing. But she's got a winged heart tattoo; my $14.95 special. Toad here. Captain. What do YOU want? You got to listen to my side of the story now. It was not my fault? ?that night at all those cops were supposed to be on the take; I am on the level! To prove it, I've got some scuttlebutt for you. Now, you set your sails for this joint downtown,? ?called Club SixSixtySix. Now there are some three guys, from Ohmtown, gonna drop anchor there with a cargo of trouble. They're looking for you little sister. Now we're even, right? So get off my back? ...oh shit! Now we're even fink. We're going to Club SixSixtySix. Now, let's roll. Wait! Follow them, yes, but don't interfere. I have a much more amusing idea. Get me What's-Her-Face. Wheeee... whoa. Oh boy! Mutants in the foyer of the club! Isn't it neat-o! Attaboy, Sonny! No prisoners! ...Okay, let's go! ...eww, Watch your step! This is the hottest antigravity club in the city, ya know. But you let mutants in and it spoils everything, know what I mean honey? They just don't know how to dress. Angel, this is Raoul Loveday. Squeeze ya later, Ralph! I got uppers and downers, ?????? screamers and shouters, ...and things that make you go sideways Hey Omar, where's this tattoo supposed to be anyway? It could be on her arm, or her leg... Or promiscuously anywhere! Wanna dance? Hey, come on, there's a booth over there. But there's somebody in it. Not for long, sweetie. Right. ???? Anyhow, he's kinda cute, but this guy had just gone too far so I told him he was a real waldo and I broke his fingers. Oh! Sorry! Pardon me! ...amazing! oof... Diz! This is no time to be lying around! I found Cinderella! Where? She's sitting right over there with Angel. ANGEL?! This could be trouble. Just keep an eye on them. I'll get Omar. Never fear Diz, I'll be here. Sit tight honey, check this out, they're playing my song! # Got you in the frigid zone Attack attack your frontal lobe # Sit atop the Empire State Got you in a mental state # Bloody fool don't you know That everything is no no no no nooooooooo! # Thinking that Nuke York isn't up to your scene? Whatcha looking for? The girl of your dreams? # Looking at the back string, whaddya think you'l find? Hot dogs and sushi, you're not my kind. # Please deposit another dime, your three minutes is uuuuuuuuu-up! Stay close Diz, we'll play it by ear. ...Angel! Omar? Angel? Bomb Squad! Get off the street! Dizzy? Omar Angel! - Angel? - O-mar... Angel? Omar. What a pleasant, and unexpected surprise. Hey big O, how's it going? Perhaps we should invite him on up for a spell? ???????????? "Yo tambi?n lo quiero todo, Omar" "Tengo todo lo que necesito" ????????? "...pero lleva tiempo" There there, come to daddy. Excellent performance, my dearrrr... What's-Her-Face. Thank you, for your help. It's been a pleasure working with you, Mok. Yes, good clean fun. All work and no play makes Mok a dull boy! Okay on number three, fade up on the girl, then give me the wall shot. The boss is ready on two. Okay, it's showtime. Look, forget it. I won't sing. And what have you done to the guys? I offer you fame, riches, and a crack at the top, you refuse... I accept that. - Good, where's Omar? - But then the chance to work with me, Mok, ...and you say "No, thank you", I'm very disappointed. Hey, listen... But still hopeful! Mok! So try to realize that I must be firm when I say to you, ...dear Angel... Sing,.. or they FRY! What are you doing to them? Stop! Stop! Mok! Stop! I'll sing! As you will, your word is good enough for me. You could have killed them. You, you're totally crazy! Thank you. Shall we see them off? Omar! Strech! Dizzy? hm-mm-mm. How are you boys doing? How are we doing WHAT, Mr. Mok? Bon Voyage! Bon Voyage! Mok, what have you done to them? They're airheads. Omar, I promise, I'll get you outta this. I know Angel, it would've been swell to work on a song together but, well, you're working with the best now. Omar, Mok is making me sing... Heeeey, I understand. Mok, change them back! Now now, I let them go for you... Omar! ...and you sing a little song for me. KIX morning news update. Mok's promise to rewrite rock history was prematurely and tragically interrupted last night when an overwhelming power surge totally destroyed Carnegie Hall and blacked out the entire city. Survivors described the destruction as "evil," "spooky," and "wow, bad karma, man." Our cameras are on the scene.... And it smelled just like cleaning fluid, and all it made me do was wanna, like, wax the floor, so like, can you tell me, like, is this concert for real, or is it just another rip off? I dunno about this Jake, nobody seems to be buying these 'I survived the Mok concert' T-shirts. And finally, our roving reporter, the late Biff Glonsky... What happened? The being destroyed Carnegie Hall but did not completely materialize in this dimension. The electrical power supply in Nuke-York is insufficient. I need more power? Affirmative. A sufficient stable energy source does exist... in Ohmtown. Ah, of course. 'ome sweet Ohm. I will raise this demon, I will not fail again. It's power will be mine. # My name is Mok, thanks a lot, I know you love the thing I've got. # You've never seen the likes of me Why I'm the biggest thing since, World War Three. Girls? # His name is Mok, so thanks a lot you think he's acting but he is not. # My name is Mok, and I'm on fire I'm the match, and I'm the pyre. # I'm the voodoo black musician priest Why, I'm the greatest thing, since World War Three!
