It's bright and clear out there today. We're looking at a high of 45 degrees this afternoon. Wind's fairly light at ten miles per hour before peaking up to 18 as the temperature dips down to 30 as we head into the evening. Now tonight, make sure you wrap up warm as conditions takes an Arctic turn. Temperature's plunging down to 23 with heavy snow pushing through overnight. A strong chance of deep drifts tomorrow morning, so make sure you keep listening for updates and wherever you are, take care out there. Now, over to Stephane with all your travel and... Elect the change we need. Vote Bob Peck for Clay County Sheriff. I'll protect your second amendment rights and defend our community from liberal elites and... We're heading to the office. Okay, then.

I'm gonna wait here. Why would you do that? Because it's embarrassing. You don't think it's embarrassing sitting out here by yourself? Beats another lecture. Hey, Tabby. Hey. Uh, what are you doing here? You should be resting. Anymore resting, I'm liable to go batshit. Eddie said he needs me riding dispatch for few hours. I figured you guys had some kind of emergency. More like a robbery. Huh. Doesn't exactly sound like a red ball. It was here. Somebody b-and-e'd the sheriff's office? Yeah, talk about brass balls, huh? How did they get in? Front door. No sign of forced entry. Ah, well, they picked the lock. Alarm didn't scare them off? Well, it might have done if someone had remembered to set it. Do I get a prize if I can guess who? Only if it's big and heavy, and I get to beat him half to death with it. So, where's Eddie? Out on a call. Domestic situation. That's him now. Yeah, my mom clipped that out of the paper. I... I was gonna take it down. Not on my account. Come on. Hey, good to see you, Tab. How's the ankle? Bugging the crap out of me. And how's Monty? See my previous answer. Yeah. Here we go. Come on. Earl Macready. Yeah, wife locked herself in the bathroom, called for help. Is she gonna press charges this time? Unlikely. She started bawling as soon as I slap the cuffs on him. I'm gonna send him home when he sobers up. Dennis, show the gentleman to his new lodgings. Come on. I wanna make a goddamn phone call. Come on. I ain't going nowhere until I speak to my lawyer. Does your lawyer have a name? You know he doesn't have enough to pay legal fees. What he needs is a public defender. Hey Dennis, where's old Bill Sackler? Deer Lake. Took his pole and went fishing. Hmm. Any way of reaching him? Not while the fisher bite. Come on. You won't lay your damn hand on me and I'll jalapeno their ass. Hey. Drop it. Hey. I wanna make my fucking phone call. Drop it. I know my god damn rights. Put a hole in him, Dennis. Fuck you, Tabby. Holster that sidearm, Chief Deputy. Eyes on me. Earl. Earl. We're a little busy here today. So the less of our time you waste, the more favorably you're gonna get dealt with. I happen to know you're a gambling man. Yeah? An unsuccessful one, but enthusiastic nevertheless. I want you to take a second and consider the odds here. There are three of us. And there's one of you. We're sporting guns. You're packing two fluid ounces of pressurized hot sauce. There's only one way a confrontation like that goes down. And it does not favor the underdog. Rumpus time's been and gone. It's nap time. With me, Tab. Nearly home. Alright, alright, alright. In we go. There. Still want my goddamn phone call. My lawyer's gonna have y'all's ass. Sweet dreams. I didn't do shit. Asshole. What's missing? Current tally is four pistols. Three Sigs and a Beretta APX. Couple of hundred rounds of hydra-shok and 20 grand the judge signed for undercover meth buys. Shit. You don't think that's weird? They took the pistols but left the heavy artillery? Yeah, kind of had me buffaloed too. You got anything on camera? I thought we were supposed to get these cameras upgraded. We did. Picture quality is just as crappy as the last ones. I couldn't agree more. So, what's the difference? New cameras are covert. Pretty much invisible to anyone that doesn't know that they're there. I got them off a spy website. Oh. But isn't that the point of having them so they act as a deterrent? Yes. So, how are they deterrent if people can't see them? Money well spent. God, I missed you, Tab. Have we put out a state wide APB? Oh, I'd like to think we could do our own dirty laundry. Now, the sheriff's election is in two weeks. And we just had a murder investigation dropped right in our laps. That's Jem Denton. Yeah, picked him up a couple of nights ago at a rest stop in Pine Hollow. Took one to the back of the head execution style. No witnesses. It wouldn't have taken five minutes to drag his body into the woods. Whoever did wanted him found. Yeah, it's a warning. Someone out there sending a message. It kind of narrows down the list of suspects. Um-hmm. Where are we with forensics? Coroner dug a bullet out of his skull. She sent it up to the state lab in Union Creek. First things first. We gotta get our guns back. There's no way I'm winning an election if I can't get my house in order. And if I lose, that asshole Bob Peck's in. And if Bob Peck's in, you'll all be drawing welfare. And that's not gonna happen. Not on my watch. Sounds like you have a plan. Anonymous tipster called in. He said they saw Arnold Beauchamp firing off pistols this morning in the woods behind his cabin. Arnie Boo? You know him? Back in the day, we were in high school together. Arnie's a doomsday prepper and a second amendment freak. He's not the sort of guy you wanna be sneaking up on. If anyone understands the need for light touch, it's me, Tab. Whaddup, whaddup? Oh hey, Tabby. It's been a minute. What you carrying there, Walter? Oh, these? These things are sprouting out like goddang weeds. You pull one up and two more take their place. Do you have any idea the kind of stink you'll cause if anyone sees you stealing those signs in a sheriff department vehicle? Nobody saw shit, boss. I'm a ninja. A ninja. No more signs, Walter. Leave the politics to the grownups. I hear you clucking, big chicken. So, what are we all waitin' for? I mean Arnie Boo, here we come. I need you to head up to Berryville. Tip off came from a payphone in Snakey Jake's liquor lounge. See if you can find out who called it in. But I thought I was going with you guys. And I thought I told you to set the alarm. Yeah, nice move, dipshit. Shit, boss, I'm sorry. Like, seriously, I mean it. You know for damn sure, that ain't gonna happen again, right? Right? You head up to Berryville, find out who called in that tip. Come on, boss, let me go-- I've given you a direct order, Deputy. See that it's carried out. Shit don't happen till I make it happen. Consider it done. Oh Tab, locksmith buddy of mine is gonna roll by in a few. Fix up the vault. Install more secure locks, front and back, okay? Where's your sidearm, Tabby? Locked up at my home in my gun safe. Well, you should have brought it with you. I'm working dispatch tonight in case you forgot. I don't like the thought of you being here alone unarmed. I can handle myself. Don't look at me. You're the ranking officer now. She shouldn't even be here in her condition. You know that. Don't talk about me like I'm not here, Dennis. I'm in charge now, Tabby. You gotta learn to do what I say. Then stop acting like a little pussy and give me a goddamn order. Alright, alright. How about you hold on to this for me, Tab? Grab some shells from the vault if you feel the need. Yes, sir. Let's roll. Sheriff's office. This is the State Police crime lab for Sheriff Reynolds. Sheriff's out running an errand. Anything I can help you with? Is that you, Tabby? Nancy? How's life in the big city? I'll tell you when I move to one. How's my favorite chief deputy? Actually, it's just plain old deputy now. Wait, you got busted down? What happened? I need a charger. Let's save that one for dark bar and a bottle of Jack. It's a date. Listen hun, I got the ballistics report on Jeremiah Denton. How about I email it over and you pass it on up to Eddie? Will do. Can you give me the headlines? I'm on like 5% battery. So, the bullet that killed him was 9 mm Luger round polygonal rifling with a clockwise twist. Fingerprints? Nothing doing, I'm afraid. You got eyes on any suspects down your way? Yo. Oh, my God. Charger. Well, Denton's been dipping his toe in the meth trade. Anyone trying to play in that, sandbox and sooner or later they'll butt heads with Tap Shannon. It's not a big one for competition. It wouldn't be like him to sneak his neck out. I'm not suggesting he pulled the trigger but if Tap Shannon didn't have a hand in it, I'll put in for retirement tomorrow. Safe bet. I'll get that email over lickety split. Take care now, hun. Bye. Shit. You could just ask for help. I'm not an invalid. A person made weak or disabled by illness or injury. You know, you're literally the dictionary definition of an invalid. Hey, what's this? Murder investigation. That's... that's Jem Denton. You know him? I've seen him around, I guess. Hey, when did it happen? Two nights ago. Fuck. Jansens need a baby sitter. It's their anniversary dinner. You're on curfew. Yeah. So, folks aren't exactly lining up to throw me work. What? You really want me to turn down an actual J-O-B? There's last chances, and there's last chances. Mom, I get it. Thanks. Make sure you go home straight after. And if I call, you better answer. Hey. Give me a goddamn minute, asshole. You're the locksmith? You're a friend of Eddie's? Sure. Well, come on in. I'd offer you a cup of coffee. But it tastes like shit. And I'm liable to spill as much as I pour. No, I'm good. Want to start with the front door first and then move on to the vault. Reckon I'll go ahead in the back? Wouldn't it make more sense to secure the exterior first? I'm just going off what Eddie said. Do you know where you're going? Um-hmm. Don't touch anything that hasn't been damaged. Yup. Dispatch, this is 1-1. Go ahead. Coming up on the cabin now. Looks like he's home. Light him up. Don't wanna spook him. Sheriff's office. Who am I speaking to? This is Chief Deputy. I mean, Deputy Temple. Well, I need to be speaking with Sheriff Reynolds. He is out of the office at the moment. Perhaps if you tell me-- Oh, when is he getting back? I'm afraid I don't have exact time on that right now. Well, maybe you should do your job and find out. Arnold Beauchamp. This is the Sheriff's department. I need you to exit the building with your hands on your head. Please give me your name? This is Pam DeLuca. I'm just gonna put you on hold for a moment, Mrs. DeLuca. You will do no such-- Who the hell's creeping around out there in the dark? This is the sheriff's department. I need you to open the front door, come out with your hands on your head. Yeah, I ain't doing no such thing. Yeah, he's refusing to exit the cabin. I have a visual on dash cam. How's everything back there, Tab? Most exciting thing happening here. I got some crazy lady on hold. Who? Pam DeLuca. Arnie, you listen to me. Come out here right now. Do you hear me? Alright Tabby, do not piss her off. She's a big hit with the church crowd. There's a lot of potential voters. You keep her happy no matter what. I'll handle it. Arnie, don't make me give you the ten count. You come out here now. Mrs. DeLuca, I'm sorry for putting you on hold. Well, I can tell you right now, I don't appreciate it. How may I assist you this evening? I have heard a group of teenagers are fixing to have themselves a party over at Deer Lake. Hello? Did you hear me? Is there a number I can call you back on, Mrs. DeLuca? I'd like to think you might appreciate the urgency of the situation, Deputy Temple. I'm sure I don't have to remind you what happens when teenagers gather without proper adult supervision. Drinking, drugs, pre-marital sex. I'm sorry, Mrs. DeLuca, I'm gonna have to call you back. Eddie, Dennis, you guys okay? No. We're fine, we're fine. Lucky for us, he can't shoot for shit. Put your fucking gun down, Arnie. Come in here and make me. Come out here now! Dispatch, this is 2-2. I'm turning around and en route to assist. Negative on that. You're just pouring gasoline on a bonfire. Stay where you are, Walter. Affirmative. I'm calling State Police for backup. No, if they get on this, the whole world will know about the robbery. You've lost control of the situation. It's my call. You're gonna get someone killed. Tell Tab, no backup. That's an order. Give it up, Arnie. This is your last chance. You come out of there now. Dammit, Dennis. If I see a shot, I'm gonna take it. For God's sake, Dennis, stand down. Stand down. If Sheriff Reynold thinks he can count on my vote when I'm being treated this poorly, he's got another thing coming. I'll tell you what, Mrs. DeLuca. I'll get a patrol car out to Deer Lake right away. How does that sound? Well, that's all I asked you for from the start. I don't think it is-- Goodnight, Mrs. DeLuca. Thank you for your call. Toss that gun, Arnie. I swear to God. Okay cool it, Dennis. Do you hear me, Arnie Boo? Hey. Alright, easy, Dennis. Nice and easy. Who the fuck is this? Arnie, this is Tabby Temple. Speak up, lady. I'm in the middle of a goddamn police siege. I said this is Tabby Temple. We went to high school together. Remember me? Tabby? No shit. Yeah, I remember you. Hottest chick in Valley Creek High. Didn't you join the sheriff's or some shit? Tell me that's not you I got pinned down behind the prowler. I'd never forgive myself. I'm back at the office, Arnie. Safe and sound. But I need you to do something for me, okay? I need you to put your gun down, walk outside. They'll kill me. Not if you put your gun down. It's too late for that. I'm already neck deep. Not necessarily. The sheriff has his reasons for keeping everything that happens tonight off radar. What reason? Put your gun down, walk outside and ask him. I'm offering you a way out, Arnie. It's the only one you're gonna get. Easy now, Dennis. Those assholes can damn well wait. You know I always liked you, Tabby. I did not. You still married to that Anthony Hombre? Not for the last 10 years. Don't like to crow over bad nes but I'm glad to hear it. He was all wrong for you, Tabb. Asshole's a pussy hound and a mean ass drunk. Put the gun down, Arnie. Go outside. Okay, okay. Hold your fire. He's coming out. How the hell do you know that? I'm surrendering, okay? I'll come out now. Back it up, Dennis. Give him some breathing space. Don't shoot. Okay, I'm coming. Hands where we can see them. Toss that gun, Arnie. Come out of there with your hands up. Hands high, walk towards me. Okay. Do not make any sudden movements, Arnie. Keep walking towards me. Stop. Down on the ground. Knees on the ground. Do it. That's it now, Arnie. You do what he says. Nice and slow. Put your hands behind your hea, Arnie. Anyone else in there? Fuck! Suspect secure. Cabin clear. Dispatch, this is 2-2. Come in, dispatch. Go ahead. I just finished talking to Snakey Jake himself. He thinks he might have seen someone he didn't recognize come into the bar this morning when he was opening up. Did you get a description? He said he was tall, dark hair, may have had a beard. May have? He was pretty drunk. Well, maybe he'll give us a little more detail when he sobers up. No, I mean he was pretty drunk this morning. And when I spoke to him just now. It seems old Snakey Jake's a full-time juice head. This is a dead end, I'm heading back. You need to roll by Deer Lake. Some kids are having a party. Break it up and send them home. You're such a buzz kill, Tabby. Eddie's got potential voters counting on it. Those kids won't know what hits them. Dispatch, this is 1-1. Go ahead. Mr. Beauchamp denies all knowledge of the robbery. We tossed the cabin, no sign of anything we're missing. What about the pistol? Yeah, it's not one of ours. We're gonna bring him back, sweat him down, see if he cracks. Well, I got your locksmith buddy here to keep me company till you guys get back. What are you talking about? Guy's practically a mute. I can see why you like him. Locksmith called me half an hour ago. He can't make it tonight. He's back there in the vault. Out of the building, Tabby. Right now. Dispatch for 2-2? Go ahead, dispatch. Give me that description again, Walter, the guy in the bar. Sure, okay. Tall, dark hair, possible facial hair. Shit. Get out of the office. Take Monty and find somewhere safe to hold up. Monty already left. Do not try and engage, do you hear me? Do you hear me? Loud and clear. I'm leaving now. I thought I told you not to touch anything that wasn't damaged. Just being thorough. Who the hell are you? I know damn well you're not the locksmith. Do yourself a good turn, girly girl. Walk away. What did you just say? I just pulled over $20,000 out of one of them lockers. Money is yours. All you gotta do is turn your back. Don't go opening a door, you can't close. Wow. Fuck you and fuck your money. So, you were in Berryville this morning, huh? Tip off's just a wild goose chase. You just wanted us out of the office. Something you need there? My ID. Uh-uh, back up. Back up against the wall. Do not fucking move. Back up. I said back up. Drop the knife. I mean it. See, I don't think you do. This is your last chance. You drop the knife or I will put you down. You best listen to her hoss. Might not looking, but that's one cold-hearted female right there. Now, kick it over here. Step away from the door, Mr. Macready. You know, Tabby, you can just go ahead and call me Earl. Step away from the goddamn door, Mr. Macready. What did I tell you? Fucking ice queen up in here. Unlock the door, get in the cell, leave the key in the lock. Get to far wall. You gonna tell me what it is you were looking for back there? No. No way you're just gonna leave me in here with this fucking psycho. Come back here, get me hell out of here, Tabby. Tabby. Fuck. Damnit, don't you ignore me. Dispatch for 1-1. Go ahead, dispatch. Suspect is in custody. I thought I told you not to engage. I got him locked up in the cell. It's the guy who broke in last night. Are you okay? He gave me a bit of a workout. No doubt about it. I have a question. There's might be more in Dennis's wheelhouse. Go ahead for Dennis. The only shells I can find in the vault are 9 mil. I've got Eddie's revolver. Any chance that could actually work? Be a tight squeeze, you'd be risking an obstructio. You might get off a few rounds but you'd be playing R ussian roulette. Turing the gun into a potential hand grenade. Hold tight, Tab. We won't be long. Got it. Fuck! Stop or I'll shoot. I'm surprised you're still here. Because you'd just love to slap a felony escape beef on my ass. He said anything to you? Not a goddamn word. Are you gonna let me out of here or what? You gotta have a reason to keep me locked up. And I know damn well, Abigail ain't pressing charges. Maybe I'll have to talk with her in the morning, see if I can change her mind. She ain't gonna say shit. Not if she knows what's good for her. Who the hell you think you are judging me? You know how many times I bought crystal off your boy? What the hell kind of mom does that make you? Dispatch to 1-1. Go ahead, dispatch. Suspect has escaped custody. What? How is that even possibl? He picked the lock and ran off. But you patted him down, right? I did not. You do not put a suspect in the cell without conducting a full body search. You know that. He had a knife. I had an unloaded gun and a broken ankle. There was no way I was letting him within striking distance. Where's Macready? He's fine. He's in the cell. Okay, well, just lock the front door and stand by. We're back in five. Copy that. Sheriff's office. This is Pam DeLuca. I have been hearing more repors about that party at Deer Lake. I got a patrol car en route, Mrs. DeLuca. Do you know where your son is tonight, Deputy Temple? He's babysitting. That's not what I heard. Well, what did you hear? That he is at the party supplying the younger teens with narcotics. I seriously doubt that. What do you expect? When was the last time you brought him to church? When was the last time you came to church? Without Christ in your life, how do you expect to bring up a boy of his age? How do you expect to teach him about the danger of temptation? The dangers of the flesh? Thank you for your call, Mrs. DeLuca. I'll have that party straightened out right away. You already said-- Bitch. I told you to answer your phone. This is literally me doing tha. Where are you, Monty? I'm just chilling back at home. What happened to babysitting? Jansens had a fight at dinner and then they came home early. Oh. Pan your camera up. What? Pan your camera around. Show me you're home. I'm not asking you, Monty. I'm telling you, pan your goddamn camera around right now. That's Jem Denton's trailer. What the hell are you doing there? I'm taking care of something, okay? So, the less you know, the better. What did you do? Mom. I might be in a little bit of trouble, mom. The last time you said that, it cost me my job. Hey, I never asked you for shi. Those were your choices. Own them. You get busted again, they will send you to youth detention. I can't protect you. You have to start making smarter choices. What about you, mom? I know damn well, those painkillers of yours were supposed to last another month. I checked the label. What the hell is that supposed to mean? You've been eating them like goddamn skittles. So, I guess I'm not the only oe fucking up, huh? Get your ass back here right now or I'm putting that truck stolen. What, you really gonna snitch me out? Try me. This is Deputy Temple, sheriff's office, Jericho Ridge. Shots fired. I got two officers down. Requesting backup. Copy that, Deputy Temple. This is the State Police. What are the officer's condition? I don't know. I can't get to them. I've got active shooters on the scene. Okay, how many shooters? Two so far, could be more. We're dispatching units immediately. Paramedics will be right behind them. Wait tight and stay safe, Deputy. We're coming to get you. Tabby, what the fuck is happening? Are Dennis and Eddie okay? You tell me they're okay, Tabb? They took a lot of fire. I saw a lot of blood. Fuck. Where are you now? Goddammit. Southside of Hardaway road. Thirty minutes and closing. I'm gonna come find these motherfuckers and burn holes in their clothes. I'm counting on it. Backup's on its way. State Police are coming to kick your fucking asses. Union Creek's 40 minutes with the pedal pushed flat. They'll never make it in time. Tabby, is that you? Arnie? You okay? Are you hit? I don't know, there's so much blood. How're the others. Sheriff's toast. Other guy, ain't doing so good. I got his brains sat here in my fucking lap. Goddammit Tabby, they're shooting at me. Keep your voice down. You're just drawing fire. You alive in there? Fuck you. Little pig, little pig, let me come in. What the hell is going on out there? I heard gunshots. Get under the bed. Keep your voice down. Let me the hell out of here. Please, please. Sheriff's office, this is Bob Peck, come in. What the hell is going on up there? We're driving past O'Malley and we heard gunshots. We're coming down now. Negative, Bob. Sheriff's office is under attack. I got at least two active shooters on the scene. Not for long, you don't. We're coming to save your asse. Right, boys? I need you and the fellas to sit tight, Bob. State Police are on the way. This is official sheriff's department business. I do not want civilians getting hurt. Who the hell are you calling civilians, Tabby? I'll be running that goddamn place in a couple of weeks. You just hang back now, little girl. Cavalry coming for you. You stay put, that's an order. Get some! Tabby. Are you okay? Yes. Push with your leg? Come on. Fucking foot. Tabby. What the hell are you doing? Tabby? We're sitting ducks out here. Tabby. Arnie? This is Deputy Temple. Active shooters have fled the scene. That's good to hear, Deputy. Back up is en route. ETA, 29 minutes. Stay armed and watch your back. I'm starting to think you like having me around. Goddamn. Y'all going fucking crazy up in here. So am I free to go or what? You'll need to make a full statement when my backup arrives. I didn't see shit. I ain't got no clue what the fuck is going on here. You can sit quietly in here or I can lock you back up in the cell. Shit! Shit! Get down on the floor now. Whoa, mom? Monty? Get down on the floor. You're alive. Down now! How did you get in? The door was locked. The door was wide open. What? Mom, Dennis and Sheriff Eddie are dead. I know, I know. There was so much blood, I thought they got you too. Shh. Holy shit, what the-- Monty, listen to me. Listen to me. You need to stay quiet and do exactly as I say. There are men outside. They have guns. Backup's on the way. We just have to hold out till they arrive, okay? Okay. Okay? Okay, okay. What the fuck is he doing here? Yeah, nice to see you again too, kid. Now we done play catch up, how about we hop in that truck you just pulled up in and bounce the fuck out of dodge? From what I've seen tonight, a car might as well be a coffin in a gun fight. We're safer inside. Get behind the dispatcher's desk. Okay. And you stay low. Can you see anything on the monitor? I see someone. Just one? Yeah. Where are they, and what are they doing? He's kind of circling around the side of the building. He's grabbing something. He's coming back round, mom. Hey, hey. Where are you going? Back to my cell. I could really use your help, Earl. Oh, so now it's Earl, huh? This ain't my fight. Y'all can handle this foolishness your damn selves. I need you to put this on. But what about you? Don't worry about me. I'm not gonna take it off of you, mom. I'm not arguing with you, Monty. Put it on. Okay. Here. Get down! Shit. Shit. Oh, we just lost our only advantage. Front door locked. Fire exit. Kitchen. We just gotta listen out. Sit tight. Won't be long now. I need to tell you something, mom. Just tell me later. I'm not gonna die without getting this out of my chest. Nobody's gonna die, Monty. Don't even think that. I'm wearing a bulletproof vest. There is a dead guy on the floor over there. And I just watched my own mom have a gun fight. So, can we please stop bull shitting each other? This is all my fault. What are you talking about? Jem Denton. Let's hear it. I was working for him. What? But I wasn't dealing, I swear. I was just running packages. And I was supposed to hook up with him the night he got shot, but you wouldn't let me out of the house. So, I think whoever killed him, they've come back here to finish me off too. How long you were working for him? Just a couple of months. So, when you got busted? I just said the shit was mine. And he let you take the fall? Well, he said you'd cover my ass. Mom, I never thought you'd get in trouble. And I never sold it. I promise you on my life. Your friend Earl tells a different story. Well, you're gonna believe that junkie asshole over your own son? How am I supposed to believe in you when every word out of your mouth is goddamn lie? I don't know what you think you know. Or what you think you did. But nothing that happened tonight is your fault, you hear me? One thing's got nothing to do with the other. You sure? I'm sure. Then what the fuck is happening? I don't know. Come with me now! Get in here. No way. It's the safest place in the building. Mom, I can help you. I can't do anything if I'm worrying about you? Damn it, Monty! For once in your life, do what I tell you. Mom. And stay low. What the hell are you doing, Earl? You know the money he offered you? Well, he offered it to me too. Motherfucker. Motherfuck-- Fucking bitch. It was you who left the doors open. Monty walked right in here. I know I locked it. He said he'd give me 10,000 to get him inside the building. Triple that if I can drag your narrow ass out of here. Earl, Earl, they've seen your face. Come on, bitch. You're a witness. There's no way they'll let you walk out of here alive. Earl! They'll kill me. Yeah? They'd be doing the world a favor. Stubborn... ass... ...Bitch. Get up. Get up. Get up. Enough. Know when to quit. It's fucking over. I bet I could name my price if I opened up a sunroof in that thick fucking skull of yours. You're just another dumb bitch who's gonna get what's coming to her. Run. Don't shoot. I'm coming out. Bitch got the drop on me. I said run, motherfucker! Bitch took my hand. She took my fucking hand. But I hurt her real bad. You get in there now. She's a-- Goddang Tabby, why aren't you on the radio? Coz it's in pieces. Are you okay? They're still out there. I wish you told me about that Beretta on your desk a little earlier. There's a Beretta in my desk? Oh, shit, yeah. That's not min. Oh, it's Tap Shannon's. Why do you have Tap Shannon's gun in your desk? I took it off him. A couple of nights ago. Tell me exactly what happened. This is important, Walter. Focus. Okay, okay. I was parked up eating dinner when this SUV blows past doing 95. I light it up and run him down, and who's behind the wheel but Tap Shannon? He starts in with his whole big shot routine. You know, "Who do you think you are? You know who I am? I'm gonna have your badge." Well, I tossed the vehicle. Found that Beretta under his seat. Well, he tells me he wants it back. He says he had a license for it. Calls me just about every name under the sun. Well, I tell him, "I'll be taking that pistol to the sheriff's office. "If and when you can produce the necessary paper work, you can have it right back, Mr. Shannon." You should have seen how mad he got. Asshole was foaming all the goddang mouth. I was gonna log the gun into the vault as soon as I got back. Must have just forgotten to do it. Based on all available ballistic evidence. The murder weapon is most likely a Beretta APX 9mm semiautomatic pistol. Walter, I have you on GPS. You're 3 miles away from Beaker's Bluff. You turn around, you head there right now. You're gonna pay Tap Shannon a house call. A what? The gun in your desk, Walter. That's what they want. It's the same weapon they used to kill Jeremiah Denton. That means-- What? Tap Shannon killed Denton? So, he sent one of his guys to break in the office and steal the gun back before we figured out what we had. The only problem is, it wasn't where it was supposed to be. Those are Tap Shannon's guys outside. You go and pay him a visit. You tell him to call off his dogs. Shit don't happen till I make it happen. Consider it done. [Albanian swearing] This is what I came for. You should have just taken the money and walk away. But your kind just can't help yourselves. Don't move. There's still one more back there. Just give me the gun and I'll go. No, just help me up. Please just help me. Be careful. Did I tell you how I broke my ankle? You crashed the truck. You know why? You said swerved up to miss a deer. I was blackout drunk. Who's the liar now? I know I fucked up, mom. And I know what it's cost you. And I'm real sorry. It doesn't matter two shits what it cost me, Monty. All that matters is what it cost you. How am I supposed to make college payments on a deputy salary? You still think I'm going to college? You're goddamn right, I do. This town's nothing but a damn trap. You're getting out. Hey, what were you doing getting shit faced anyways? I've never ever seen you buzzed. I went to see your father. What the hell you're going to do that for? He's making good money now at that garage. I figured it's time he put some of it towards your college fund. So, he asked me in for a drink. I said yes. Well, now I know you're bullshitting me. Whatever else your father is, he's just about the most charming man alive. So, we got to drinking. We got to talking. Pretty soon, we got to disagreeing. Let me guess. He said that I was never going to amount to shit. And anything spent on my education would just be throwing good money after bad. I told him exactly what I thought of his opinion. He slapped the drink out of my hand. Then he slapped my face... a couple of times. So, I took my service weapon and I laid it, smack across his jaw. He fell down like a sack of a laundry. And he's on the floor crying. Bleeding. Begging my forgiveness. I thought about all the years I'd wasted and the bullshit he got away with. Everything he's taken from us. I had my gun, aimed square at him, finger on the trigger. And if I'd had a couple of more drinks, hell, maybe even just a one... I would have pulled it. There's no doubt in my mind. I was so disgusted with myself, I drove straight to O'Malley's and drank until I couldn't stand up. Hey mom, don't feel bad. If it were me, then I would have probably shot him. Walter? I'm at Beaker's Bluff. I'm going in. You watch your back. You don't take any shit from anybody, you hear me? Affirmative. Come on, now, Walter Judge. This here's your moment. It's all on you, big pimp. No fucking prisoners. God! Come on! Okay, you keep a lookout. You yell if you see anything. I got you, I got you. And you stay low. You hear me? You're making one big unholy mistake, son. I ain't your fucking son. Get on your goddang knees. You're gonna tell your boys to back the fuck off the sheriff's office. I don't know what you're talking about. You call them. And you tell them it's over. I'm gonna give you the motherfucking five count, dickhead. Thmn I'm gonna take your head clean off your shoulders. One. Two. Three. Let him go. I'm calling the sheriff right now. You do that. Sheriff's office. This is Dakota Shannon. I got one of yours over at my house holding a shotgun to my husband's head. Sounds about right. You put me through to Deputy Sheriff Reynolds right away. Sheriff's dead. So is the chief deputy. And it's your scumbag husband who did it. Oh, he's been with me all nigh. Because he doesn't have the balls to do his own dirty work. I don't have to listen to this. You'd better get used to it. You're gonna be hearing a whole lot worse real soon. I'm literally holding the evidence that's gonna put that no account shit stain on death row. I don't believe you. I don't give a two-knuckle fuck what you do or don't believe. What matters is you listen to my colleague and lower your weapon right now! Fucking drop it! Fuck you too! Put away! You shut the fuck up, you motherfucker! Put a bullet in his head right now. No, no, no. No! No! Come on! Fuck. Don't do this to me. Oh, what have I done? Mom! Mom! They're coming. Get down! Down! State Police, how may I direct your call? This is Deputy Temple at Jericho Ridge. I need an update on my backup. Units estimate they will be with you in eight minutes. Do you have an update I can pass on to them? Tell them to step on the fucking gas. Give it up. Your boss is dead! Deputy Judge just blew his fucking head off! It's over! You call his house if you don't believe me. Come on out, and I won't kill the kid. I'mma give you to the count of ten. Then I'm coming in, and he gets what you're owed. One. Two. I've only got one bullet left. Three. Four. Five. You're not going out there, mom. I can't protect you, Monty. Six. All you've ever done is protect me. Seven. Okay, give me your cell phone. Give me your cell phone. Eight. Nine. Ten. That's it. You and the kid are gonna burn. Fucking! Get in there. Monty, there's a knife. Get the knife. Monty! Monty! No. No. Oh, God! My boy. Vault. Go to the vault. Go. You see the shot, you take it. Shut the fuck up. Walter, you okay? Yeah. I'm dinged up, but I'll live. Well, this asshole's wife ain't looking too hot. You put the gun down, boy. Or my man will shoot you dead. Well, suck a dick, grandpa. Now, it's time to earn your pay. You step up and you take control of this. Whaddup, whaddup? Good job, Deputy. State Police should be here any minute. Late as usual. It's over. It's over. Come here. It's over. Sheriff's office. You promised me you'd stop that party. I know damn well there are drugs present and it is your son Monty who's supplying-- I ever hear my son's name come out of your mouth again, I'm gonna drive around to where you live and throw your face first through a plate glass window.
