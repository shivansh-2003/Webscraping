Middle or butt? Butt. You got it. Hey, listen Charlie, I'll take a rain check. Alright, Lou. I'll see you next Wednesday, huh? Okay. Today's Swiftwater, tomorrow they'll come on in. Shit. I'll have to pay me a lot more money to get me to show these views. There you go, pal. Jason Bucklee ··· Charlie the Bartender What's your name? -Charlie. -Charlie. Maybe I get something to eat, some lunch maybe? Today's special is Turkey with all the fixings. I just had some of my stuff and it's damn good. Alright. Sounds pretty good. I tell you what, let me have a Turkey all the way and when you bring it out I'll take another one of these here. Hey, Big. pitch me a Turkey all the way. -Uh, say what's your name, pal? -Oh, Billy. Nice to meet you, pal. I'd like to say you have a beer at the bar or a pig if they shove one in the piggy. No, I'm fine here. Listen, Bill, you didn't by any chance come out my way as Swiftwater, did you? I hear they got topless going on down there. No, I didn't pass that way. Topless. I'm thinking of putting it in here myself. -I gave up with the times. -I guess you're right. Yeah, I guess you'll come up here to see the house alright. The old Blair mansion. It's alright if it's a road a piece. If you ask me, it's all apart of the Blair fortress. Yeah, it's built around the turn of the century. Old Lucian Blair himself reported stone by stone all the way from Europe. Oh, look at this. I love that gal. She can carry more stuff than a pack of you. Can I get you something else? Some ketchup? Maybe barbecue sauce? Alright, I wouldn't hurt her with barbecue sauce. Charlie, what's so special about this Blair mansion? I mean, other than it came from Europe. There's all those queer goings on up there. Right from the very beginning. Of course, everybody figured it out when they found the body. See, they thought he died of natural causes. According to what my daddy told me, it was her that killed it. Just as she took a gun, pointed it to his head, and pulled the trigger. [Shooting] Snoring. Come on, you got me hooked on it. Uh, you got through with that? Well, alright. You don't pay any chance to play darts, do you, Billy? Yeah, I have some. You do? Bless my heart. Why don't we play a game of darts for, say, a dollar a game, you know, just to keep it interesting? Alright, you're on. I think I'm being hustled. No, no, no, sir. Come on. Billy, you're gonna love this game. All the way around from one to twenty, you gotta get a bullseye to win. Just watch me. Oops. What was that to? There. It's all in the wrist. You folks sit back there. I'll have a pair of cats in a minute. -Billy? -Billy. You ever hear the word "sader"? Something mythical, uh, "half man, half goat". Yeah, something like that, or, uh, "lecherous man". You ever hear the word "saderiasis"? Sounds like a skin disease. I'll admit, it's an itch, alright, but, uh, ain't nothing you'd go to the doctor for. Well, come here, now. Here you go. There it is right here. Oops. There. Look. "Saderiasis". An uncontrollable desire for sex. This is what they all were. They were all "saders". Uncontrollable lust. Eric Edwards ··· Lucien Blair Nellie Gold ··· Girl No. 1 Velvet Summers ··· Girl No. 2 Honey Wilder ··· Evelyn Laurien Dominique ··· Girl No. 3 Cheri Champagne ··· The Maid I love you. And the others. The hundreds of others you take to your bed. These nameless cunts. Do you love them too? You don't have to be in love to fuck. I fuck because I must. I satisfy a need. I love you. But I need them. They're nothing more than food to me. Food to satisfy my hunger. And they do. If only for a fleeting moment. Each in their own way. These nameless cunts as you call them. They do not substitute for love. They simply satisfy my need. Look how beautiful it is. There's my life. Sweet Rose petal lips wet with her need. Look at her face my love. Look at her face. Look and understand. What she feels. I feel. But her hunger will end with her orgasm. Coming from me is only the beginning. I must have more. This is my curse. And I will revel in it. My groin swells in its need. Cunt. I must have cunt. Bury myself in its sweetness. My prick will not be denied. He is master. But I am slave. Because. The mother's come. Leave me. No. It will not go. I turn away. But the reflection follows after me. And I can only pray that soon he will leave me in peace. How beautiful they are. Each one taking me higher than the last. There can never be more joy for me than this. I need them my love. Each and every one of them. Those innocent eyes. Those bright red cocksucker mouths. Eager to swallow my manhood. I am complete. And for the moment. I am fulfilled. There are other things I could turn to. Things to divert me from the open pit. Drugs. Alcohol. That scammer. There is an excitement for you. Everything you own. On the turn of a wheel. Everything you possess on one number. The outcome so grave. She must blot out everything. Just feel your blood race. As you listen to the wheel turning. Listen to the spokes click. Now there is no joy for me there. I must return to the flesh. Is there anything other than this that I could do? I would do it. You are where you want to be. Yes. You're obsessed by religion. You're saved. You're obsessed by flesh. What are you then? A beast. A perverted animal. You are my breath. My life. I live for you. That one quick feeding moment. Just one more. One more. Open up your country. Open up. -I'm not another one of your cunts. -Oh yes you are. You're the biggest cunt of them all. Say you love me. Yet you treat me just like another fuck. It is because I love you. My need for you is greater. Damn you. Say it. Fuck me. Pound into me. -Say it you cunt. -I'm your cunt. Fuck me. Talk to me like the dirty street whore that you are. Give me your breath. Give it to me. Give it to me. I want it. Oh squeeze your cunt. Make me cum. Make me cum like nobody else has ever before. -Squeeze it. -Yes. Yes squeeze it. Squeeze my cunt. Get me off like no one has ever gotten me off before. Yes. Squeeze it. Squeeze it. Yeah. Yes. I won't stop until you drain your life from me. Yes. Oh yeah. No. You want to cum? One last time. One last cum. Make me cum. One last cum. To last forever. Oh...... That's the damndest thing I've ever heard of. I say it arises. You know but it seems most guys I know have a touch of it. Yeah well I guess it's kind of like Millie's Barbecue Sauce. A little bit goes a long way. All right so all that stuff happened around the turn of the century right? That won't happen. Well nothing much to prohibition I guess. You know how to play backgammon? Yeah. Well. Billy if you like dogs. You're going to love backgammon. I tell you what you go first this time. Yeah that prohibition or something else Billy. Telling people they can't drink. Shit. Well some religions for good alcohol. I mean the Methodists and Moslems right? That's right. Anybody stupid enough to be a Moslem or a Methodist don't deserve to have a good cold beer. All right I'll drink to that. Matter of fact I'll drink to it too. Of course then I'll drink to anything. Ain't there that organized crime you're always hearing about? Hell before prohibition there wasn't enough crime to get organized about. What about the house Charlie? -The Blair Mansion remember? -Well I tell you something. At that time the Blair Mansion was just perfect. It was big enough to be a hotel, a speakeasy and a whorehouse all wrapped up in wine. Yeah that was fast money and fast women. It must have been something. Gotta wish I'd been there don't you? You know something? That house just attracted us on the thing. My hotel they had some of the most beautiful women in the world. All lined up. Just waiting to be plucked. Of course the funniest thing about it was the kid. You see why Blair had a thing? A little girl named Lillie. Of course they never saw her. She was born after he died. But she had it too. What she had was the satyriasis. The satyriasis thing. Couldn't get enough of it. I guess it's in the blood. It takes a lot. I wouldn't mind if old Peg had a touch of that herself. You know what I mean? You do know what I mean, don't you? Yeah, that child could have been anything. Could have run the whole place. Could have been this great madam or something like that. She was into it all the way. Couldn't get enough of it. Lillie the Black. They say she was a beautiful woman. Sharon Mitchell ··· Lillith Blair Damn, what a night. Never seen it this slow. Got a cigarette? You ever seen it this slow, Charlie? Don't worry about it. It's early yet. They'll show up. Think so? Yeah, you know those guys. They're always either coming or going. Yeah, coming or going. Oh, dear. Damn, it's almost seven o'clock. I've got to get dressed. Don't go. Ben, you know I got to go. No, you don't got to go. -Damn it, Lillie, you owned up. -The fucking place. That's right. I own the fucking house. So I got to be there then, don't I? Not the way you do it. I don't understand you, Lillie. You work harder than any of the girls working for you. You just can't get good help these days. I'm serious. I love you, Lillie. I just can't stand around and let every Tom, Dick, and Harry. Fuck me? I'm a whore, Ben. That's what I do for a living. That's what I did when you met me. You didn't seem to mind it then. -I didn't love you. -What do you do now? I love you. I've never said that to anyone before. I love you. Oh, yeah? Well, I love you too, Honey, but not during working hours. I've got a virgin for you, Lilith. It's some sort of sailor initiation. And you've been chosen to pop his cherry. That's what I'm here for. The others want to have a go on you too. Something about sharing the experience. You send them up? I'll send them down. I can't remember when I had my last gush the first time. Well, I'll refresh your memory. Gushy first time. First time I ever said that to anyone. First time Honestly. First time.... anyone honestly.. I love you. I want to be with you all this time.

And if you can get it up again, you come back up here too, all right? Come on, fuck it, you're gonna make me count. - I love you. - I see. - I love you. I just can't stand around and watch every taunt, dick, and Harry. - Fuck me? I'm a whore, Barry-Bag. That's what I do for a living. I gotta count. I gotta count, it's like. Like I'm alive. It's like nothing else in the whole world. I gotta have it, I gotta have it, Ben. You're gonna make me come. You're gonna make me come, yeah. You're gonna make me come. Ooh. Ooh, ooh. You're gonna make me fast. You're gonna make me push* it nice and fast. Do it again. Make me come. Come with me, Liz, please. Come, come, come. It's all right for you.

Please. - Ramirez. - You've died, doesn't it? He's still bending your ear with his story. Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Did he tell you about the hippies yet? - Oh. There you go. Come I tell you, Lily, I just can't understand how a person does something like that, you know what I mean? Wait, didn't you just say they don't have any control over themselves? They're still a piece of shit out of me. Well, anyway, that's about all that happened through Prohibition. Things were pretty quiet up till about, well, I'll say the '60s. Then a bunch of hippies moved in and took over the place. Not even so bad, it was a little bit off the wall, but all that love and peace and grass and mass. It didn't hurt nobody, see I mean, it didn't get on nobody's nerves. Then the '70s come along. This music crowd moved in. Electronic bullshit, if you ask me. Bunch of spaced-out retards took over that place and turned it into a music studio. Can you believe that shit? Well, there's a real circus then. Run around all over the place with black leather jackets and smoking them funny cigarettes, you know? Now, don't get me wrong now, women want half that. If you like purple hair, but men, they want some other. Must have been something. All that booze and drugs and sex. Now I'm all for the music.
