I will talk about one of my important good friends, Fumi's story. Every day, Countless meteorites fall to the Earth, Micro Meteorite Exploration Handbook. Most of them disappear completely due to friction with the air, Only a few become small fragments and fall to the Earth. Of course, no one knows where the meteorites fall. Ota Coast Civic Hall. I dreamt of myself drinking alcohol, Starting at 8 p.m. "Sunflower Sobriety Club." At first, I had three glasses of undiluted alcohol, which tasted great. Then I had four glasses Mixed with water. So I woke up this morning feeling a bit hungover. Alcohol even chased me into my dreams. It was such a mess. I'm really fed up with alcohol, I need to keep going. Alright, next up is... It's Ms. Igarashi's turn, please. Okay. I'm Fumi Igarashi. I've been sober for two weeks now. The first time I drank was in the summer of my second year of high school. It was with the captain of the handball club that I had a crush on... He rejected the love letter I wrote to him that night. That's so mean. The chance of a meteorite hitting humans is one in a hundred million. It means that it basically won't happen. But unexpectedly, on that night... A meteorite that shouldn't have hit anything actually landed on Fumi's car. What? Yeah, okay. You just left Ota Coast? Then wait for me there. Alright. What's wrong? Fumi called and said her car broke down, I'm going to pick her up. We're not a taxi service, you know. Kohei, go take a shower quickly. Did you hear that? I heard. Sorry for the trouble. Are you hurt? Oh no, hit your head? It's okay, I'm fine. Strange people gather on this beach at night. Instead of throwing away the alcohol, why don't you give it to me? That's the rule of the sobriety group. And if we don't waste it like this, we'll end up drinking it. Yeah, that makes sense. I'll come pick you up tomorrow, is 8 o'clock okay? - Sorry. - That's not what you're thinking. You noticed? You scared me. Thank you. I know. I know the real reason why Fumi started drinking. "Tsuyukusa" - These are nice - Okay. The hem on this side doesn't feel right. Ah, really! Then tighten the thread a bit more? Okay. The lines of the pattern aren't so straight either. I'll go check the triple-fold sewing machine. Yeah. How many boxes of goods did we ship yesterday? Go and check the inventory. Okay. You can touch the actual item. This one is on the soft side, it's average. And this one is on the harder side, feel it. I see. Right? The current trend is undyed ones. The bubbles feel like they'll be really beautiful too. I can't even lift my shoulders these days. You didn't do any heavy lifting. It's my wrist that hurts. That medicine I ordered online is completely useless. Are you using that? No, it's useless at all. But it works for me. - What's bothering you? - I have a bit of rheumatism pain. Huh? Rheumatism pain? Yeah, but it really works, I feel much better. Really? Of course, how could it be fake? But... what you said is true, right? - You're lying. - Good men don't exist. But there are some decent ones, right? Yeah, there are. Listen, my purpose for going to the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is not to find a man. Those two things are unrelated. Whether it's an AA meeting or a pottery class, They're both good opportunities to meet men. That's right. Listen, I simply want to quit drinking, that's all. It's really delicious. Stop staring. Do you know why the factory manager went to Taiwan? What do you mean, "why"? Just for sightseeing, right? Isn't that obvious? He went to attend a matchmaking party. Yes, I heard about it. Blind date? Stop staring. His wife ran away, so he felt lonely. He couldn't find anyone in this small town, so he went to Taiwan. But he got dumped again and only learned Tai Chi before coming back. But he's a decent person. Hello? I see. Hmm? Why? - Did you notice? - Huh? Notice what? Her cell phone ringtone. Recently, she changed it to two different ones. Alright, anytime is fine. Wait for me, 20th century. You're so slow. - Is it on the other side of that mountain? - Yes. Ota Coast is even farther than I imagined. Shouldn't the meteor burn up halfway? Some of them don't burn up completely. If we can't find it, then it's just an ordinary stone, right? Let's try looking for it. No, I still have to study. I'm asking you. Is someone gossiping about me and Kobayashi? Kobayashi? Are you talking about the one from Class 2? Yeah. I haven't heard anything. Why are you asking? Good, then forget it. Oh no! Not again? It's the ampere rating. Ampere rating? Like when you turn on the air conditioner or washing machine, Or when you're ironing clothes, it usually doesn't trip the circuit breaker. If it's happening, it means the ampere rating is set too low. My grandma also does that to save on electricity bills. Contact the landlord and ask him to adjust it. Oh, so it's the ampere rating. Yes, the ampere rating. Kouhei. Chinese, social studies, math. Only music is improving. And arts and crafts. - Do you want to take extra lessons? - I'll work hard on my own. Do you want to see the propeller up close? Forget it. I absolutely don't want to shave my head. Alright, I got it. I have no idea what my mom told you. She didn't say anything. Just that it's summer and she wants her son to stay cool. If your grades are bad, you have to shave your head. That kind of thinking is so outdated. Those two things are unrelated. If it's because of grades, then your whole head would've been bald a long time ago. It's so frustrating. Hey, why didn't you go fishing today? Because I want to slack off. It feels terrible. Your dad really wants to teach you how to fish. What's so terrible about slacking off? Don't you love eating sashimi? Sashimi is meant to be eaten. No need to go out of your way to catch it. Alright, alright. Here it comes again, your ridiculous reasoning. You should never eat sashimi for the rest of your life. It smells so good. What is it? Cream stew. Consider it thank you for letting me cut your hair. Looks great. I also baked some bread. Look, isn't it nice? Feeling very delicious. - Do you have jam? - Yes, I bought it earlier. You're so slow, what are you dawdling about? Wow, no, this one won't do. Don't bother with me, okay? Fumi, look, this is really unimaginable. You shouldn't wear this one. Of course, it's just average. This isn't underwear, it's a thong. Thong? Just a string, right? Or is it an eye mask? It's underwear, just underwear. You want to wear the string? What's your intention? Is it your turn to criticize me? This one doesn't deserve to be called underwear, it's a girdle. You're clearly younger than me, so what? This is organic cotton, the texture is very soft. Stop fighting over a string or a girdle. By the way, let's go to the Springwood House next time? I can't accept Springwood House, their products are so outdated. What about Man Tang? I can't go to either of them, I want to go to Champs-Élysées. But Champs-Élysées is too far away. If we only choose clothes nearby, then don't be a woman. You really know how to talk. Fine, let's go to Champs-Élysées, I'll drive. Great. Hmm, my skills have deteriorated. Can't help it, after all, I haven't made hamburger patties in a long time. The diameter of the Earth is 12,756 kilometers. The distance from Earth to the Moon is 380,000 kilometers. About 30 times the diameter of the Earth. - Hi, Yu and Haruka. - Hello. Be careful on the road, nice clothes by the way. Kohei. Let's go have fun. Can I borrow your son and your car for a while? I don't mind about the son. - Be careful with the car, okay? - No problem. - I'll be right there. - Okay. Nice catch. It must be a meteorite, for sure. Is that so? I don't know what it is. But something definitely hit my car. How could a meteorite hit the car? It's definitely a meteorite, I saw it. Alright, alright, I understand. Let's go check it out first. But let's go look for it ourselves. Won't you be angry at the 20th century? Did you make plans with her? Don't worry, she's not interested in meteorites. There's something I wanted to ask you. I remember that girl's name was Naomi, right? Why do you call her "the 20th century"? That girl... she likes a type of pear called "the 20th century." Go, 20th century! Just because of that? Look at this. Not this one. Not this one. Kohei, do you want the vanilla or Caramel flavor? Caramel. No, Caramel is mine, take it. None of these are meteorites. It's okay, let's pick them up just in case. Is it really a meteorite? I think so. We should ask the university's institution for help with the investigation. That's cool, but we need to give it a name. A name? I'm not sure either, but those stars are usually named after the person who discovered them, right? We need to name it! Wow, it's dripping, be careful. You're really something! We found the person who got hit by the meteorite. Found it. "November 30, 1954" "Located in Tallassee County, Alabama." "Hodges House, Oak Grove City." "Pierced by a meteorite" "The radio in the house was broken and hit." "Mrs. Elizabeth Hodges, who was taking a nap." "It was a rare accident" "Later, Mrs Hodges" "Attracted curious eyes from the media." "She later divorced her husband" "Died at the age of 52 a few years later." I think it's best for both you and Kohei. That's why I said those things. Don't involve us in your matters. That's just your wishful thinking. When we remarried, I knew you would be transferred to different places because of work. Then why didn't you ask us to come with you? You're being too loud. Because Kohei isn't your child, right? i didn't say that. He's your child, after all. Majoring in Aerospace Engineering. Although it's not confirmed without detailed analysis... But this is a meteorite. A lunar meteorite. A lunar meteorite? A meteorite that flew from the moon, lunar rock. Lunar rock? You see, in this granite... There are rocks similar to labradorite. And there are many white... Looks like glass marbles, right? This is the same as the lunar rocks brought back during the Apollo program. Kohei, you picked up a lunar rock. Kohei, that's so cool, it's a rock from the moon. This woman was hit by a meteorite. Don't talk about such embarrassing things. He always drags others into his matters. Congratulations, Kohei. Here you go. Huh? Is it for me? Yes. Thank you, can I accept it? I already have another one. By the way, turn it into a pendant. Drill a hole in it and hang a chain. - Is that okay? - Can it be made into a pendant? The president of our alcoholics' support group specializes in making them. Make it a lunar rock pendant! I'm so happy, it feels like I'll be happy once I wear it. I hope so. After all, it's a one in a hundred million chance. Yes, one in a hundred million. - What happened to that person later? - Huh? The person who was hit by the meteorite. that… What are you doing? 20th century and Kobayashi? what are you laughing at? Oh, long time no see. Hello. This is for you. The alcoholics' support group is on hold, so I wanted to come and see you. It would be a waste to pour these drinks into the sea. Then I'll accept them. You haven't drunk in a while, how about a glass of watered-down one? - I feel like eating spaghetti. - Alright. No problem, wait a moment. When you're drunk, you look like a painting. Stop tempting me like that. The feeling of waking up the next day after getting drunk and not remembering anything, I've had enough of it. That's great then. What's so good about it? I've been through it too. I used to stick to the bronze statue of Kinjiro Ninomiya in elementary school and study with him. You're here again. I also bought some mirin. Ah, thank you. I'm such an unreasonable boss, making the customer run errands. - Here, please have some. - Thank you. I'll start eating. Sorry, have we met before? In the park, you were playing the leaf flute. Huh? Do you know each other? - Your flute playing is really good. - I'm so shy. This is "Rikyū-sō". When made into a flute, it produces a beautiful sound when blown. I see. Here are some bitter melons for you. I always accidentally plant too many. End up with a bunch left over. so… - But... - No, you're helping me. Well then, thank you. My name is Shinoda Goro. I'm Igarashi Fumi. I'm very happy today. - Me too. - Well, I'll be going now. - Good night. - Good night. You won't tell Naoki, right? No, I won't. - But... - I know. I'll tell her later. Sooner or later, she'll find out anyway. This town isn't that big. People here thrive on gossip. There's enough gossip to have two bowls of rice. Who's that guy? He's a monk from Seigen-ji Temple. Seigen-ji Temple is... Yes, my husband's grave is there. But how did you...? It's because... The sutras he recites to me... They sound like flirting to me. "When parting, the next love already begins." Quoted from Antonio Inoki. Fumi, do you know about "dolphin passing"? I don't know. It's when you paddle your surfboard out of the wave zone. and dive under the waves. He calls it the "duck dive." Doesn't the wave come crashing down? You push the front of the surfboard like this, into the wave. Then you sink your whole body into the wave Do you know what I'm trying to say? I don't regret it. I don't feel sorry for my deceased husband. That's how things are. I only graduated junior high and have never left this small town. It was after I started dating that monk that I learned... What "offshore wind" and "aerial maneuver" are. Wherever women are, because of men... They make their world broader. If you're happy, Komiya, I won't object. Stop acting like you know everything. Fumi, you must be interested in someone too, right? There's no need to hide it. I can tell. After all, I've walked a longer road than you. "Women and driving are quite similar." "Sooner or later, you'll crash." - Quoted from Bireinosu. I'm just using the monk's words. He always tells me all sorts of things. But that's part of his charm - Can I ask you something? - What is it? Have you ever been hit by a meteorite? Yes, I have. Really? - Look, it's right there. - This? Yes, that's a meteor. Did anything good happen because of it? The sticky notes don't fly away anymore. That's it? Compass Needle Bar. Why did you choose that name? Well... I used to be a crew member on a whaling ship. "A whaling ship"? A ship that chases after whales, you know. Long before you were born, I saw a big whale spouting water on the surface of this sea. You're lying. Ouch! Don't you believe me? Alright, alright. So, in the end, the whale jumped up. "Endless lifespan, endless lifespan, the friction of five kalpas until it cracks." "The sand grains of the sea, the water travels to the end of the fish." "Clouds come to an end, wind comes to an end." "Food, drink, sleep, and a place to stay." New house? If you want to become a company employee, then you have to accept being transferred. Even though this is a rural area, I really like it here. Here, I have important friends. And people from other countries are also working here. The people here are very kind. I feel guilty towards Kohei too because he also likes it here. So you've decided to move? Yes. If we go our separate ways after that, I feel like that guy won't come back again. Oh, you're moving, huh? How long will the construction on this site continue? Sorry... I just can't get through. That's enough! Do we have to go through this every day? - How long will this go on? - Sorry. Are you even listening? You idiot! You may pass. Answer me quickly! Thank you for your hard work. Sorry. Dandelion, purple jasmine, thistle, plantain. Even the leaves of the clover can make sounds. But I still prefer Tsuyukusa. - Want to give it a try? - Huh? Me? It's quite simple... which one is better? Here you go. - Fold the green side of the leaf... - Yes. Align it between your upper and lower lips. Slightly roll it into a cylindrical shape from the other side. - Don't fold it completely... - Okay. Just a little bit more, clip it. Try not to puff up your cheeks, blow on the upper edge of the leaf. Try to make the leaf stick to your upper lip. Amazing! Tuck your chin slightly inward. Almost there. See, it blew out. Great job! Great, it worked Don't worry, Mom understands everything. I didn't come to this town for that kind of thing. Fumi introduced me to that man as her son. That annoyed me a bit. Fumi also said something strange. Where's your husband? My husband is on a whaling ship. "My husband is on a whaling ship." - Where is the ship heading to? - Currently in the Southern Ocean. Fumi is a liar. You can't host this kind of gathering without drinking a bit. Then why don't you step down as the chairman? You make it sound so easy. Do you know how many people I've helped quit drinking so far? I don't know. Every year, people send me New Year's cards to thank me. Several of them. Helping others is... my way of survival. It's not as carefree as you describe it. That's true. I hide and have a drink to relieve boredom, then continue to help others quit drinking. What's wrong with doing that? I'm sorry. No, I was too harsh with my words. You mentioned it earlier, I'll help you string the chains. That's okay. It's settled then, consider it my gift for keeping it a secret. No need for a fee for my work, just pay for the chains. Alright. You guys better not slip up and say anything. Did you hear that? Anything is fine, except for classical music or something like that. Anything is fine? Do you have any favorite songs? Favorite song? If a gust of wind passes through your heart... Yes, that song. My mom used to sing it when I was a child. Kohei. Ah, it's him. I'm done with work and going home. How about a bottle of ice-cold root beer? Root beer? Wow, what is this? It's root beer. It contains flavors like vanilla, licorice, and nutmeg. Although it's called beer, it doesn't actually have alcohol. But it's more suited for adult tastes. Uncle. Yes? What do you do for a living, like your job? I'm a dentist. A dentist? But I don't practice anymore. Why did you quit? - Can you keep it a secret? - Yes, I can. Because it started to hurt, the teeth inside. You're a dentist, you can treat yourself. Won't you tell anyone? Dentists can't treat their own teeth. Really? Quite philosophical, isn't it? So what are you going to do? Yamada Dentist? That's where Arin goes. That doctor is great, I'm much better now. Dentists can't treat their own teeth. It's starting to taste good. It has an adult flavor. So why did you come to this small town? To get dental treatment? Toothache is something you can endure. Then why did you come? Why, you ask... Never mind. Do you want to go somewhere with me? Hmm? Where do you want to take me? Hurry. This way. Finally, we're here. A UFO? I'm taking this to Nanmen Star Two. You'll take care of Fumi. At the other end of 4.73 light-years. I'm tired of Earth, so I'm leaving. Can you? Stop riding, don't ride anymore. I have something to tell you. I'm not actually Fumi's kid. She said her husband is on a whaling ship, but that's also a lie. Everyone around me is a liar, that's all! - Hi, Fumi. - Hello. Ah, by the way, hollow heart vegetable. The person who played the leaf flute said he wants to give it to you. - Give it to me? - Yes. He said he's thankful for the bitter gourd you gave him, and it's on sale at the supermarket. He also said he doesn't know how to cook it. Where is he? That convenience store over there, going to buy tomatoes... Hey, wait. I know how to cook it. I'm starting. Sorry, the dish! I forgot to bring a dish, I'm sorry. Hope you'll find it delicious. I'm going to eat. It's delicious. That's great. - Please go ahead. - Sorry. What are these photos? My son. Two days after his seventh birthday. I was preparing dinner, ran out of soy sauce. I asked him to go buy some. He refused, saying the bicycle chain would fall off if he rode it. The cartoon show on TV was about to start too. So, I scolded him. Later, the bicycle chain fell off at the level crossing. He fell down, and a train passed by. And that's why you came here? Actually, I could have gone anywhere. As long as it was far from Tokyo. As long as I couldn't hear the warning sound of the level crossing gate. Oh, right, there's dessert. Pineapple cake, a souvenir brought by the factory manager from Taiwan. I'll make some tea. - Then I'll go. - Okay. Hmm... About the kissing part... If I kiss you, would you be bothered? Ah... I'm sorry, please forgive me. Thank you for your hospitality, I'll leave now. Sorry, just now I... Your occlusion doesn't seem quite right. - Does it hurt here? - A little. Your second molar has a cavity, but it's not severe. It's about time you got it treated. It's in a good mood today and can speak. Junichiro, brother. Junichiro? Junichiro, brother. I love you, Junichiro, brother. What's the name of the monk? My daughter finds it amusing, so I taught it to speak. His "Jun" means "pure." That's not important. So, you have to wait for a whole week? It's when my sister and her husband and son come. I want you to take care of it. It would be disastrous if they found out about the monk. My sister doesn't know about the monk. Please, I'm begging you. What's up with this bird? That's how it is... What kind of place is that? Niigata? Yes. It's great there, and the fish is fresh. There's a delicious soba noodle called "Katakigi Soba." And the starry sky is beautiful too. How much does this cost? Huh? Didn't the university professor say something? "The museum will buy it." "Some people will compete in the auction." Will it be worth a million or more after selling it? What will you do after selling it? After I graduate high school, I want to study in the United States. The United States? Yes, I want to become an astronomer when I grow up. There's a place in Wisconsin called the Yerkes Observatory. They have the world's largest refracting telescope there. Your parents will surely feel lonely. Although I've always called him dad, He's just a fake. Kohei. Say it again, try it. If you say such outrageous things again, I won't be your friend anymore. Are you going to the United States or somewhere? It's up to you. He said, "Let's see who returns faster, me from Indonesia or you from overcoming alcoholism." I never expected that in the end... He decided to marry the daughter of a beer company executive. Can you believe it? you just said that. Have a drink too. I think I'll pass. What do you mean pass? What do you mean, "What do you mean"? I'm not laughing because everything is so absurd, but that's just how alcohol is. It makes you laugh when you want to cry. Fumi, you're not getting any younger. Don't you understand that? Let me take you home. Hi. So, you don't really hate fishing, do you? I don't really hate it. Give me a moment. Dad, You don't have to force yourself to call me that. Just call me "Uncle" like before. By the way, where are your mom and dad? My parents? I don't know where they are. We're poor at home. I was raised by relatives. You don't like your dad? Yeah, we haven't been in contact. So, Kohei, I'm fine being alone. You can continue living with your mom here. Got it? There's a fish on the line. Huh? oh! When will we be able to see each other again? How about Saturday? Do you want to go up the mountain with me and play the leaf flute? Sure. Regarding the mountain hemp part... Hmm? It originated in Egypt and is rich in nutrients. If boiled for too long, the vitamins and pantothenic acid will be lost. It tastes delicious when dipped in soy sauce and vinegar. Got it. Well, I'm leaving then. - Good luck with your work. - Thank you. Hmm... I haven't told you anything about myself yet... Mr. Shinoda. Before I turned 50, I was hit by a meteorite. After that, I met you, and just that makes me very happy. That's enough for me. See you on Saturday. I love you. I love you too. Sorry, I can't wait until Saturday. I want to completely understand you. Leaf flute. My wife taught me how to play it. There are a lot of Tsuyukusa on the mountain behind my house. What about your wife? She committed suicide. She suffered from depression for years. I couldn't do anything for her. I could only treat her tooth decay. Miss Fumi. I'm going back to Tokyo. Tsuyukusa can be found anywhere. They are flowers that are ubiquitous. Okay. Ah, sorry, sorry. I ran out of cigarettes, so I went far away to buy them. Hey, hi! Boss, give me some wine. Hmm? Alright. Xiaoliang, it's all over. It's been tough all the way. You've been worried about me all along too. But it's all in the past now. Fumi Igarashi work hard starting from tomorrow. Something's not right with Production Line 3, I'll go talk to the factory manager about it. It made me have a dream. As for your mother, well, briefly... Briefly, she became a woman again. Announcement: The clinic will be temporarily closed. Dr. Shinoda, dentist. Kosuke. Kosuke. Who the hell is Kosuke? I don't know. Who is this man? I told you I don't know. But this bird... So you don't know which man it is? I really don't know. Hey, keiko. Wait a moment. Keiko! Mr. Goro Shinoda. "Limitless, limitless, the friction of five calamities." "Grains of sand in the sea, the water travels to its end." "The clouds come to an end, the wind comes to an end." "Eating, sleeping, and having a place to stay." "Tenacious like a roadside iris." "Paibo country, Paibo country, Paibo country..." "Shuryuji, Shuryuji, the king's..." Fumi, thank you. I'll leave Kohei to you. Understood. Hello, hello. Have something to eat, you haven't had breakfast, right? I'm not hungry. I'll eat later. Look, you're not in good spirits. You'll be bullied by the naughty kids in the new class like this. I've decided. I'm going to make myself happy. After all, I'm a woman who was hit by a meteorite. The train is about to arrive. Please stand up. Let me hug you. - Hug? - Just a little. Fumi, I'll be shy. One more hug. Just one more. - Thank you. - Thank you all. - Take care. - Okay, thank you. Fumi. Will you truly be happy? Even if I'm not here, will you still be happy? Dr. Shinoda, dentist. - For safety's sake, I'll get you some medicine." - Okay. - When it hurts, take it. Take care of yourself. - Alright. The inflammation isn't severe. It's because your teeth don't fit together properly that you feel pain. - Let me treat the decayed tooth as well. Okay? - Okay. I'll have to grind down the decayed part, so please open your mouth wide. If it hurts, raise your left hand. Rinse your mouth. I'll raise the chair higher. You don't have to endure it all the time. As long as you help me alleviate the pain, that's enough. If I'm not in pain, I can continue to persevere. The chair is going to tilt back. Come on, open your mouth. Miss Fumi Igarashi, speaking. "Fumi, how have you been? I'm doing well." "It's still hot over here, but it doesn't feel like it's going to rain." "It's comfortable living here." "Last week, I went fishing with my dad." Look, I caught a black porgy. Kohei. Stay sober tonight, too. Don't drink. Stay sober tonight, too. Don't drink. Stay sober tonight, too. Don't drink. Stay sober tonight, too. Don't drink. I'm strong. I'm strong. Fumi, the one who encounters a one-in-a-billion probability. Statistically speaking, it's impossible for her to be hit by a meteorite a second time. But that doesn't mean she can't make herself happy, right? Isn't that right, Fumi?
