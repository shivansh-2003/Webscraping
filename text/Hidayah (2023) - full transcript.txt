Carefully. Oh, my God. Bahri, come on out for now. Help him out, Jal! Bahri! Bahri. We have to finish burying her today. Four Days Earlier... Bahri! Customer! - I'll be right there. - Have you finished fixing that car? Yeah, but there's still a problem with the ignition. Then it's not done. Now go ask him what he wants. Ustad Bahri. He doesn't look anything like an Ustad. - Just call me Bahri and lose the title. - Since when? What's wrong with your car? I don't know, problem in the acceleration. The engine is still too hot. Why don't we let it cool down a bit? - Coffee? - Sure. - How are you? - I'm fine. You have a job in Jakarta now, Hasan? No. I came to Jakarta looking for you. How did you know I work here? You're my old friend, I would have found you. One way or another. And here I am. I get it. Want one? No, thanks. I heard you were released from prison. Relax, almost all of us know about it. But I know you're a good person. That doesn't bother me at all. No one cares about me anyway. How's Mekarwangi village? That's what brought me here. I hope you can come home with me. We need you there. What happened? It's scary there now. What do you mean? Do you remember Ratna? - I do. - She came back home... ...and now she's very ill. I think she doesn't have much time to live. But we're not God. Maybe He will heal her illness. What sickness does she have? No one knows. She's bedridden ever since she got home. And she will start screaming in pain at 6 p.m. every day. Why do you need me? I thought the village already has a Kyai (village doctor) to handle that. He's old and sickly. You're our only hope, Bahri. I'm not the same Bahri that you used to know. I can't offer anything to the village. Guidance doesn't just fall from the sky. Sometimes, we need to go and fetch it. I can't. Mekarwangi and Ratna are part of my past now. Maybe there are people somewhere who are more capable to help. Just not me. Again. All good. - Take this. - No, keep your money. - Please, Bahri. - Please, Hasan. Bahri, I still hope that you change your mind. We need you in the village. Give my regards to everybody there. I'll see you later. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Has this car been fixed? Yes. What did you do? I fixed the dynamo starter. Why fix it? Why didn’t you replace it? While you're at it, replace the battery, the wiring and everything else. That's cheating. Don't tell me you never cheat. I can't work like this. Bahri, you're an ex-con. The only person who will hire you is me. You have nowhere to go. Replace the dynamo and the battery. Help me. Help me. Bahri... Help me. Help me. Help me! Help me... Ratna? Bahri, please help me. Help me, Bahri. - Ratna! - Please help me. Help me. Ratna! Call the ambulance! Swallow slowly. If you can't take care of your daughter, just kill her then. You've become a burden to this village. I'm sorry, but I'm here on behalf of the village people. I'm sorry, but you're going to have a baby soon. Do you want someone wishing your baby to die? Then take your daughter to Pesantren... ...they can treat her with exorcism. I still remember what your husband did to me. He just left without paying his debt. Then one day he just hung himself. Why don't you and Ratna hang yourselves too? Why don't you just die? Death is out of my control. Are you talking back to me? Hey, I'm not finished! Idiot. Bahri. Hasan. Finally, you're home. I want to help Ratna the best that I can. Thank God. Are you heading to the Pesantren? Yeah. I want to see Abah. You'd better go see Abah now. People here are acting strange lately. Just like I told you yesterday. Okay. Are you coming? I can't. How about we meet again tomorrow? Okay. Bye. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Abah. Bahri. How are you? I'm fine. Honey, tomorrow fry fish and make sour soup, for Bahri. Okay. You still remember my favorite food. I will never forget anything about you. Although I think you've changed. What good news do you bring to Abah? Actually, nothing. I just met Hasan yesterday... ...and I remember how I miss you both. Is it about Ratna? Where are you going to stay tonight? I don't know. Your old room is still empty. You can sleep in your room tonight. Thank you. If I was not this sick... ...I would help her and also the rest of this village. Excuse us, I think he needs to rest. Mat... ...take Bahri to the room at the end of the dormitory. Yes, Ma'am. Let's go. In the name of Allah... Excuse me. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. This is your room. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Peace be upon you, Bahri. - Peace be upon you too. - This is the book that I borrowed yesterday. - Thanks. - No, thank you. It's a good book. People said Majnun went crazy because of his love for Layla. Majnun’s love and bond with her is so beautiful. But there's nothing good about a love that is lonely and full of suffering. Abah wanted me to tell you to teach qira'ah in the new students’ class. Okay, I'll be right there. Peace be upon you, miss. Peace be upon you too. Can I ask your parents’ permission to propose to you? It's okay by our religion to kiss before we get married, right? My God, Asep. - Excuse me, Bahri. I have a class to attend. - Yes. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Wait for me! - Asep! Wait! Allah is the Greatest. Don't be a jerk. I'm being a jerk? What did I do? I just said hi to her and proposed to her. - I'm not violating our religion's rules. - Oh, God. I'm not stupid. I know when you're being religious or you just feeding your lust. The only difference is you're being a hypocrite and I'm being sraightforward. Do you think I didn't see what you were doing with Ratna? I seek forgiveness of Allah. Dear, God. You're in a Pesantren. This is sacred space. We're not the same. Excuse me. - Yeah? - Abah wants to see you. Okay. What's wrong? I'm just tired. I know you since you were little. You always hide your feelings. My life is ruined because someone spread lies about me. Everyone I know... ...don't want to know me anymore. Then they're not your true friends. I've lost everything. They said I caused the death of one of the patients I treated. I still remember what you said... ...that God will help anybody... who helps others. Well... Life and death is controlled by fate. Your patient's death was not your fault. My mother's heart was broken... ...and it affected her health. And she died while I was still in prison. Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return. They wouldn't allow me to attend her funeral and bury her. Be strong and just let it go. It's not that easy. When was the last time you prayed? I haven't stopped praying since I was a kid. Why did all this happen to me? You can't change your past. You can only hope that God has beautiful plans for you. I'm sure that everything happens for a reason. Pray for your mother. A good child should always pray for his parents. What's the real reason for you to come back here? I want to help Ratna. Exorcism? Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Ma'am. Bahri. You want tea or coffee? Tea if you don't mind. Wait a moment. Here you go. Thank you. How's Ratna? Since she got home... ...she hasn't spoken at all. But I hope someday she'll speak again. Can you help her? Please? If that means she's going to die, so be it. It breaks my heart seeing her like this. If Allah wills. I'll try my best. Thank God. Come on, honey. Pray to Allah. Say "I seek forgiveness of Allah". I seek forgiveness of Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. What's wrong? I... - I can't. - Bahri. - Hasan. - Bahri, calm down. The Bahri that I used to know wouldn't give up like this. But I've changed. But he's still there deep inside your heart. Ask your heart, it will tell you what to do. Please, help Ratna. Don't you feel sorry for her? You've come so far. Why don't you take another step? I know you'll help her end her misery. I think my presence here would only distract you. How about I pick you up later tonight? Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Dear! Oh my God! I seek forgiveness of Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. Can you help us? Come here. Bahri's here. Bahri... - Can you get me a bowl of warm water? - Sure. Ratna, let's pray. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. I seek forgiveness of Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Ratna? Ma'am. The light is out. Ma'am. Hang on. Let's see Ratna. Come. Ratna? Honey? Ratna! Ratna? Dear? Honey! Ratna! Ratna. Honey! Ratna. Why don't you search at the back? Okay. Ratna. Dear? Ratna? Ratna. Ratna. Ratna. Ratna. Ma'am,.. I need to light this lamp. Hang on. I can't find her at the back. I can't find her either. Ratna! Ratna! Ratna! Dear! Ratna! Ratna! Dear... Ma'am. Honey! Come down here! Come down. - Come down. - Ratna! Please, come down. Ratna! Ratna! Wake up, Ratna! I know you're still in there. - She's dead! - No! She's dead and everybody else you've treated, Bahri. Is this what you want? Please pray to Allah. Ratna! Your faith is too weak, Bahri. Stop acting like you're holier than us. Ratna, please stop. Help! Ratna? Ratna? Ratna? Ratna? Ratna? Ratna? Honey. - Dear. I seek forgiveness of Allah. - Ratna? - Ratna? - Honey! - Dear... - Please forgive me, mother... Ratna? Wake up, honey. Bahri... - Ma'am. - Don't... - Please, help her. - She's gone. - No! - Let her go. - Ma'am. - Go away! She's gone, Ma'am. Ratna is finally dead. She smells awful. Ratna is dead now. - Al. - Yes? Hold this. - Keep walking. - Alright. I'll be right behind you. Why do you carry the body of a whore through the village? Be careful with what you're saying. Slander is worse than murder. I know. But not when I'm speaking the truth. I think the people wouldn't like it if you bury her body in our cemetery. It's going to desecrate our village. Right, guys? The only ones who are desecrating our village are the living people like you. Go find another cemetery, don't bury her here. They have the right to be buried in that cemetery. She's going to be buried next to her father, and she has the right. Oh my God. - Dear. - Yes? Dear. I'm in the kitchen. - What are you doing? - I'm boiling water. My baby. My baby, my good baby. My baby, my sweet baby. Your sweet baby needs nutrition. We can't keep feeding it with only tempe. I don't want our baby to become a weak kid. And don't keep feeding her water spinach or your kid will be sleepy all the time. How about giving the baby some meat? Listen, dear. Wait till I get paid, okay? Fine. How about you go get me a raw mango? Mr. Gilang has the tree. Are you asking me to climb a tree this late? I'm scared. It's the baby who's craving, not me. If you ignore it, the baby will be born drooling. You want that? Of course not. Who wants their baby to be drooling non-stop? Fine, I'll get you the mango. But don't tire yourself out, okay? - Okay. - Promise? - Promise. - I'll be right back. Take care. That's my husband. Honey! Honey! Honey! Dear! Dear! Forgive me, my baby. I couldn't protect you. I couldn't protect your mother either. Please forgive me. What happened? My baby is stillborn. I've been waiting for my first baby to come, but it died. Be strong. It's easier said than done. I'm so depressed. I'm blaming Bahri for this! Burhan told him not to bury Ratna in this village... ...but he wouldn't listen. He's so arrogant. I won't let him get away with this. He has to pay. I agree. Bahri... ...what is bothering you? Last night... ...I prayed for Ratna. But just when I thought everything was okay, apparently... Bahri... ...you don't pray with your mouth. You pray with your heart. You can't expect God... ...to hear your prayer... ...if you are still doubting Him. You have to leave the past behind. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Abah, you have visitors. Thank you, I can take it from here. In the name of Allah... Bahri. Hasan. Why is it not over yet? Maybe Ratna wants to tell you something. What happened to her after I left this village? Few years ago, after you left for Jakarta... ...her father was drowning in debt. He got desperate and committed suicide. Then they turned to harass Ratna and her mother. They even threatened... to kill and rape them. I seef forgiveness of Allah. Then Ratna went missing. - Where did she go? - I don't know... ...but after that her mother started paying back their debts to people in the village. I'm afraid what Burhan said is true. Peace be upon you. No one is here. Peace be upon you. Since you returned to this village and acting like a hero, you've created so many problems. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm just doing what a good Muslim does... ...for our brothers and sisters in need. What did I tell you? You helped a whore. I don't understand. Please explain to me. I worked in a night club as a bouncer, and I saw Ratna working there. My goodness. It can't be. You don't believe me? I don't care. She was very popular in that club. Her customers were rich people. She was so sexy, she even turned me on. Those men tipped her... ...millions of rupiah. She shared a little to me... ...to shut my mouth she said. "Please don't tell people in our village." Then what happened to her? She got sick and retired. I just found out about her return not long ago. Maybe she didn't take care of herself and let those men not wear a condom. Why did she do that? Why are you asking me? How should I know? Now leave. I need to go to work. Excuse me. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Dad. I brought you some snacks. Just put them in the kitchen. How's Yanti? Still depressed. But they just lost their baby... ...I understand their situation. Burhan. Burhan. Burhan. Burhan. Burhan. What's wrong? Ghost! Hey, asshole! Show yourself, I'm not afraid! Honey. Come here. What's wrong? Is there something bothering you? Honey, how are you? Are you okay? Please forgive me. Honey! Honey! Burhan is dead! Burhan is dead? Everybody, Burhan is dead! Burhan is dead. Asep, Danang, Burhan is dead. He's dead? I failed. A person’s time of death is already written. But they keep blaming me. We can't force them... ...to believe us. This is a battle you must fight. Every religious man has experienced it. People think they're crazy and evil. But the only difference is we're human too... ...and we will keep on fighting. Help us! Never... ...believe the... ...devil's tricks. When a person dies... ...they're no longer bound by worldly matters. They will return to the spirit world. So did Ratna. She can no longer handle her unfinished worldly matters. I hate to see what has become of this village. Even God can't change someone's mind... ...unless they are willing to change. But I'm not strong enough to save them all. You have to answer to God... ...for what you've done with the gift He gave you when your time comes. Don't forget that. Oh, God... Please forgive my daughter's sins. I'm returning her to Your embrace. There's nothing you can do... ...if you are still doubting God. Leave the past behind, Bahri. Maybe this task is hard... ...because you... ...are one of the chosen ones, Bahri. If Allah wills. Please forgive me... ...for I couldn't protect her. Please forgive me. Please give her the best place in heaven. Please forgive all her sins. Please forgive me, honey. Please forgive me. - I'll be right back. - Bahri. Help me. Oh my God. - What happened? - He's possessed. Do you know who I am, Bahri? Pray to God. I know you're inside. You can't get rid of me! Hold him down. Start praying. Look at me. Hold her. Don't hypocrite! - Pray to Allah. - Idiot! Hold her down, and start praying. Pray to Allah. Pray to Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. I seek forgiveness of Allah. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Everybody, keep praying! Keep praying! Bahri! Bahri! Bahri! Allah is the Greatest! Hold her. Everybody, calm down. Sit them down. Your prayers won't work on us. Everyone? Let's recite Al-Fatihah together! I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the outcast, from his direct and indirect temptations. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. Allah is the Greatest! I condemn you, satan! Begone! Begone! Oh my God. Get water for them to drink. - Right now. - Inhale, exhale. Bahri. It's Abah. Can you look after them? Help them. Abah. - Bahri. - Yes, Abah? Abah... I bear witness... ...that there is none truly to be worshipped but Allah... ...and I bear witness... ...that Muhammad... ...is the messenger of Allah. Abah. Abah? Abah... Abah. Abah. Oh, God... Bahri! Bahri! Come out, Bahri! Excuse me for a moment. Bahri. The village people already know what has happened in the Pesantren. Oh my God. Please don't make a scene... ...and respect Abah. We're sorry for making a scene. But Bahri should leave this village. Do you agree with me? Yes! Oh, God. Stop bullying him. You have no heart. It's okay. I'd better leave. It's not because I fear them, but to respect Abah. Good if you realize it. Who knows if you were the one to bury him he'd become like Ratna. - Oh, God. - My goodness. - How about we bury him instead? - Yes! Leave. That's Ratna's grave. Thank you, sir. Can we leave now? What are we waiting for? In a minute, miss. Miss. Do you need help? I want to leave this village as soon as possible. They had been so cruel to my friend. What's your friend's name? Ratna. Ratna? Do you know her? I worked with her in the city. Why don't you drink with us? Finish the bottle. - I'll see you later. - Where are you going? My next client is waiting. How about next time? Fine. - The usual. - Sure thing. - I leave. - Bye. What? Nothing. It's your mother again? Who else? Take it. - It's for your mother. - I don't want it. - Take it. Send it to your mother. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - You're so kind, my beautiful friend. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I've already kept aside some money for my own mother. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I need to pee. Ratna. You still owe me money. I paid you yesterday. That's it? When do you expect to pay up your father's debt... ...if you only pay me that much each month? With all those charms you're wearing... ...you could manage to pay me more. Do you know... ... who put all those charms inside her? I don't know about that. But she told me it was Burhan's friend from this village. She told me the charms needed animal blood as sacrifice. Initially blood from a chicken, and later on from a goat. And it kept escalating until it finally required the sacrifice of someone she loved. But the only one left was her mother, so she refused the sacrifice... ...and eventually she got sick... ...and left for home. Why are you still here? Do you have a death wish? Guys, I only want to clear Ratna's name... ...because I know she was not the only one who's guilty here. You talk too much! Get up! Get up! Hit him! Tell me... ...who inserted the charms in Ratna's body? Forgive me! Tell me! Danang! Bahri! Bahri! It was Danang who put the charms in Ratna's body. - How's the backyard? - All clear. - Let's go. - Hasan. This is too dangerous. Let me handle this alone. Wait here, and help me by praying. Be careful. In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. My goodness. Die! Bahri. Why did you have to help Ratna? You knew... ...she was a hooker, right? She was too greedy and always wanted more. So she put charms in her eyes, her vagina... ...her anus and then all over her body. When the bill came to her door, she refused to pay. Stupid hooker. Once you sign a contract with the devil... ...you're going to pay till the end of time. You should've listened to what I said. To go back to the city. But you chose death instead. I used her to spread fear in the village. And fear will make them forget their God. And it will be easier for me to draw them away from God. Many more will sell their souls to the devil... ...and my black magic will gain more power. Never believe the devil's tricks. You can't expect God to listen to your prayers... ...if you still doubt Him. You can join Ratna in hell. You don't pray with your mouth. You pray with your heart. And this time even your God can't help you. Die! Allah is the Greatest! Bahri. Ratna. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank God. Now Ratna has got a proper burial. And may you all live a healthy life and full of blessings from God. - Amen. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Thank you. - Yeah. - Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Take care. Thank you. Bahri. I'm sorry. All this time we... ...especially me. We were wrong about you. It's okay. Everybody would do the same if their life was in danger. Ma'am, will you forgive me also? I forgive you. I'll see you again later. Bahri, Ma'am. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Please. Thank you. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Good afternoon, Ustad. Good afternoon. We're from the police. Where can we find Hasan's family? Hasan lives alone. But if it's urgent, you can tell me. We just want to inform that Hasan was in an accident. My goodness. He was in a coma... ...and few days ago he died in the hospital. Wait, sir. Which Hasan are you talking about? This person. There was an accident. Call ambulance. Help him out from the wreckage. Careful. Easy, easy. Bring him to here. Careful, sir. After I left the village... ...what happened to Ratna? Do you want tea or coffee? Tea if you don't mind. Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return. Sir. So what do you say? I'm his family. - I'm a relative. - I see. If you don't mind, can you deliver his body here to Pesantren Al Mukmin? Sure. I'm going to need his ID back. Thank you for your cooperation. We'll see you again. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Thank you, Hasan. Asking guidance from God is not easy. There are so many obstacles and sacrifices. I had to lose the people I loved first. My mother, Abah... ...Ratna, and Hasan.
