[choirs singing, ululating] [women speaking in IsiZulu, voices echoing] [in IsiZulu] Nompumelelo, my child, from today you're no longer a Dube, you're a Makoe. You're not a little girl anymore. From today you're a woman. [women murmur agreement] Nompumelelo, you know that my sister worked hard to raise you in the absence of your father. Don't embarrass us like we didn't raise you well. There's only one authority in the home and that authority is his. All those girls out there want to be in your position. Be a true woman and be a good wife. A woman's duty starts in the kitchen and ends in the bedroom. And where you struggle, another woman will gladly step in. [phone buzzes] [ululating in background] We asked a very high price for you and they paid it. Go and support your husband. Let there be no complaints about the price they paid for you. Be respectful. Love your home. Do not disgrace us. [buzzing resumes] Apologies, Aunty. [phone buzzing] [buzzing stops] Sorry. -[buzzing resumes] -As I was saying, Nompumelelo… Sorry, Aunty. [in English] Hello? Carine, yes. Um, could I get it to you in the next, uh, two hours? Apologies again. OK, thanks, bye. Eh… [in IsiZulu] Apologies to my elders… but I must go. [women murmuring] [woman in IsiZulu] Is this what they paid for? Is this what they paid for? [man on radio] Yeah, it's tough this time around. With very weak economic growth, that means we keep on adding to our debt. [phone buzzes and chimes] Uh-uh, I am so sor… What are you doing? Payroll waits for no man, friend. You do realize that today is your wedding day? My wedding day, yes. I got so behind with this wedding stuff that if I don't run this payroll, no one's getting paid. Nom, look at me. You know that if you wanted me to help you with this stuff, you could have asked me to do so in the morning on my computer if it meant that much to you. So it's either you're trying to come for my promotion, or you can just tell me what's really going on. Tumelo is great. Like… He always has been. I mean, I… I look at your love life and I wonder. Finish that sentence and I swear to God, today will be a traditional funeral. Just seems so final. You know? Like… I don't know, I just… I wish Morris Chestnut would interrupt it, like, um… -Trey Songz… -Uh-huh. Omarion. Or Darnell. -Arnez, girl. -Ooh! -[Nompumelelo chuckles] -You took it back, buddy, yes. -Yes. -Ah, honey. But you have to realize in all seriousness, this ain't LA. It's Jozay and… [phone buzzing] I don't know, you can't just bunk out on adulthood the same way that you would bunk out on lectures. You know it's not about ownership. -Hi, Tumelo. -[whispering] I'm not here. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, don't worry. She's actually right here. Uh, hold on. You literally want me to get epilepsy and then cancer and then die, disappearing like that? -Epilepsy, then cancer, and then die? -[Tumelo chuckles] [Tumelo] Yeah. You know, it's not a nice feeling, everyone asking you, "What's happening?" "Where is she?" Did I ever tell you that on… his last day, sick as anything… he took a 20-hour flight to my audition at Juilliard? Your pops? [Nompumelelo] Hmm. Then he showed me around the city like it was his. I'll never forget that place. Then a year and a half… after he died I remember… coming back from my jog and my mom holding the rejection letter in her hand, like she had won. And I remember that tore you up. Oh, well. [sighs] I guess she did win, so this is my dream now. Huh. Ouch. Didn't mean it like that. Tumi, I don't know why… I don't know what my panic is about. I know you're my person. I think it's the idea of being… bought, you know. Lobola, by the Makoes. Go on. What if it changes us? It's not going to change us. You know, we're still us. You're still you. You're still Gary's daughter. I mean, that nose of yours says it all. [chuckles] You're driving the man's car. But for real… I don't own you. You know, we're just… putting on a performance for the audience. But we're still us. Promise? I promise. [crowd singing and ululating] [Tumelo sighing] I kind of set the place up for you. [soft jazz playing] [Nompumelelo] Kenny G. No, it's not Kenny G. Please pretend to be interested. I put so much work into this. Hmm? [sighs] So… we should, uh… probably get to it, huh? Huh? Let's have fun, la vie. Yeah… wait for it, babe. -[belt buckle jingles] -[Tumelo sighs, strains] [Tumelo straining] Tumi, I'm tired, eh? Tired? What do you mean you're tired? [Nompumelelo] I'm tired. -No, you can't be tired. -[Nompumelelo] I am, though. It's our wedding night. Well, it's not… it's not the wedding wedding. What do you mean, it's not the wedding wedding? Oh, like it's not, you know? No, I mean, it's real, it's real. But, I mean, we haven't like… we haven't signed, so… Hmm… Don't you think the big white wedding is the wedding? What are you saying, Mpumi? Like, we haven't… we haven't signed, so it's not… it's not the real… Wow. Well then, good night. [blows out candles] Oh… [music stops] Well… [light switch clicks] [crowd ululating, applauding] Um… -Follow me. -O…K. Mm-hmm. [Carine laughs] [Nompumelelo] Whoa! [Carine] Oh! Consider it as a late wedding present, Mrs. Makoe. [laughs] Why didn't you tell me about your wedding, by the way? I would never have rung you if I'd known. No, it wasn't a wedding. It was more like, um… [Carine] You're not married? [Nompumelelo] No, I'm married, um… It was just, um… Never mind. Well, anyway, um… this is what senior management looks like. Congratulations. Oh, well… I never thought it would happen so soon. You've done so well here. You've treated our firm's money with integrity and discretion. You deserve this. Thank you. Well, thanks, um… I still need that payroll by the end of the week, though. -Yes, sure thing, sure thing, sure thing. -[Carine laughs] Nompumelelo Makoe… [Nompumelelo] ♪ Up there I go ♪ ♪ Up there I know ♪ ♪ Up there… ♪ Yo, babe. That song of yours is annoying enough, huh? Oh, look at what we have here. Annie: the Musical. Oh, tut-tut-tut-tut! Right here, come on, please, please. Please. Wait, OK, cool. Let's talk about this. -Let's talk about this, OK, cool. -Let's talk about it. [both laughing] Oh, man… [murmuring] I don't even know how to use these things anymore. Hey, now here we go! Our superstar! -♪ It's a hard-knock life for us ♪ -[Nompumelelo laughs] [piano playing on videotape] What a girl. Huh? You were quite pretty back then. [Nompumelelo laughs] -[young Nompumelelo singing on video] -Cute, no? [in IsiZulu] Hi. I'm happy that Nompumelelo got that promotion. [in IsiZulu] Thank you, Ma. Now the real wedding preparations can happen a lot sooner. [Tumelo] What is it with this family and weddings? Traditional weddings are real weddings. No, my son. You sitting on a blanket and receiving gifts does not constitute a real wedding. [Tumelo laughs] Nompumelelo, please take that tape out and put it back in my kist where it belongs. [Tumelo in IsiZulu] Can we keep watching? I've never seen it before. I've been subjected to those songs for 17 years. Remove it at once. [laughs] Hopefully she's eased up on all that singing. Slowly but surely. That took you long enough. Eh… Tumelo, please excuse us. [in English] Don't forget what this industry did to your father. Mother, what kills me is that you just watched. You watched me suffer that rejection on top of Dad's death. You watched me go through my life thinking I wasn't good enough. You just… you watched! I had to protect you. Protect this family. You are being selfish right now. I don't even know why you're complaining. Now, I'm sorry I lied to you, but I had to. And one day you will thank me for it. You have a husband. You have it all. Ma, you have it all, because this is what I want! You'll find me in the car. [in IsiZulu] Goodbye, Ma. [woman speaking softly on radio] We must acknowledge the violence of Apartheid… So none of this is what you want? I don't mean it like that. I just don't want it like this. Look, don't you see this changes everything? How? The letter's nine years old, Mpumi. But it proves that what I see in me is valid, that what my dad saw in me is valid. I'm good, Tumelo, I'm… I'm crazy good. So, so what are you saying, that you want to go to Juilliard? I'm saying I want to go to New York. You're not thinking clearly, Mpumi. I want to perform, Tumelo. Why? Why there? Huh? You can do this here. Why do you have to go all the way there? I can't stand it here, Tumelo. I can't stand it here! It's all I've known, and this is not good enough for me anymore, it's just not. [scoffs] And what about us, Mpumi? Hmm? Did you forget that we're married, Mpumi? What about us? You can't honestly expect me to be happy knowing that I gave up my dream. What about me, Mpumi? Hmm? Come with me. I have to go, Tumelo. This is my shot. Tumelo, look. Look! Look! [paper tearing] No. You're not going there. I did not pay all this money to be blindsided and then dragged across the world like that. -Mpumi, you're not going there. -You paid? You paid? [Tumelo] I'm your husband, Mpumi. I'm saying no. You're not going there. You're not going anywhere. [scoffs] Are you not getting ready for work? This is impossible. [keying rapidly] Tumi… Hey, Phindi. Hi. Are you with Mpumi, by any chance? Nope. I thought she's at work with you. [Phindi] Tumi, your wife is in serious trouble. It seems that she's overpaid herself. Wait, wait. What are you talking about? What do you mean, overpaid herself? [Phindi] Yes, on the payroll, it says she gave herself an extra 60,000 rand. That's theft. The last girl that did that is in jail for fraud, and is now fighting Malume Patronella for her virginity. So where is she? This is mad. Oh, my God. Any luck finding her? Um, not yet. Um… Please, just give me one more moment. I'm going to ring head office, OK? -OK. -Sorry. -Oh. -[line ringing] What is going on? [phone buzzing] [muffled announcements over loudspeaker] [phone buzzing] I'm from South Africa. It's a long flight, 15 hours. It's actually 9 p.m. in South Africa, so I just, uh… [driver] Where are you headed? Uh… 2-3-5 West 42nd Street. [Donald Trump] This may be the most important tool that they can think up. We're gonna build a wall. We have no choice, we have no choice. [announcer] Now the major heat wave threatening the country tonight, 175 million Americans in 33 states, and for many, this is the hottest weather in years. [announcer 2] Investigators are questioning the man behind a deadly terror attack in lower Manhattan… -[phone chimes] -…an attack he apparently committed in the name of ISIS, just blocks from the World Trade Center. [leader] Show me what democracy looks like! [protestors] This is what democracy looks like! [leader] No hate, no fear! Immigrants are welcome here! [protestors] No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here! [leader] No hate… -Hey. -[woman] Hello, ma'am. -How can I help you? -I'd like to book a room, please. Certainly. May I have your name? Uh, Nompumelelo Dube. Nompu…? Nompumelelo. [woman] Nompulalillo? [chuckles] Here you go. I see this was issued a while ago. Yes, nine years ago. You haven't aged a day. And how long will you be staying with us? Uh… ten days? Are you sure about that, Nompul… ma'am? Yes. Um… No, let's do ten days for now. All right. That will be $1,500. [alarm beeping] [phone buzzing] [beeping and buzzing stop] [hip-hop playing] [woman] So, where are you going, my dear? [Nompumelelo] Uh, the Marriot Hotel in Times Square. [woman] The Marriot Hotel. Oh, yeah. I'm Adwoa. [Nompumelelo] Nompumelelo. First time in the city? [Nompumelelo] No, actually I was here ten years ago with my dad, but I don't remember it that well. [Adwoa] Ah, don't worry yourself. I've been here 15 years and I still get confused sometimes. [both laugh] Hmm… how long are you here for? [Nompumelelo] Indefinitely. -[Adwoa] What are you doing here? -You're gonna think I'm silly. No, tell me. Ah, I wanna perform on Broadway. Ah! You're a singer? HR manager. [laughs] -I knew you'd think I was silly. -No, no, no, don't worry. I mean… you're a foreigner… with an indefinite plan. In Donald Trump's America. I mean… anyway, bigger problems than worrying about what I think, girl. You know? So anyway, listen to me. What you do is you come up a little and turn downtown. 124th Street. Yeah? Down subway, Times Square. You go see it. -Just up the street. -Up the street. OK. All right, thank you. [Adwoa] Yeah. Listen! Craigslist. -What? -For part-time work. Google it. It will help you. Thank you. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I'm here for the auditions. Social security? [Nompumelelo] Like, my social security number? Yes. Oh… no. A week! I paid you 15 cows of lobola for a week of marriage. That's ridiculous. OK. You have an agent? Um… no. No? [chuckles] Oh. Thanks. Well? What do you have to say for yourself? Tumi! Where do you want the cows, hmm? Your garage or mine? Hi, I'm Nompumelelo. Nompumelelo. I'm, um… Nompumelelo. Nompumelelo. Um, my name is Mpumi. Uh, I'm from South Africa. And I'm auditioning for the role of Layla. Where are you from? Johannesburg. Where? [man] And wena Elizabeth. You know very well that I will be expecting every penny of lobola back. I understand. [man] Wena… [man] Do you have a green card? No. Thank you, miss. Your journey ends here. Have a nice day. [siren wailing] [pounding on door] [sirens continue] Don't give up. You're almost there. -Hi. -[clerk] Yes, ma'am. [Nompumelelo] Yes, I'd like to extend my stay, please. Certainly. May I ask for how long? Ten days. All right, that'll be $1,500. I'm sorry, ma'am. There appears to be a problem with your card. Insufficient funds? It can't be. [clerk] It doesn't say that. Just that there's a problem with your account. OK. Thanks. Thank you. [man] Ma'am, it appears that your account has been frozen pending some police investigation. Any idea what this is about? [phone beeps] Ma'am, I understand your dilemma, but we cannot extend the stay without additional funds, and you only have one more night available. Thank you. [phone line ringing] [mother] Hello. Hello? [mother sighs] [in IsiZulu] You're in very big trouble, Nompumelelo. And for once you'll be happy to know that I can't do anything to help you. Good luck. [dialing phone] [line ringing] [Tumelo] Hi. You've reached Tumelo. I'm unavailable… [Nompumelelo keying] [man] Nah, it's, um… to get an audition, you gotta be a part of the union to get in. OK. Um… OK, thank you. Where are you headed? Um… The subway… the subway, I guess. Not too far from here. I'll get this. You sure you're not working? Nah, my boy inside will cover for me. Yes. I'm Jaquan, by the way. [Nompumelelo] Seriously? What? [Nompumelelo laughs] Nothing. Oh, snap. I see, I see, I see. And Umfufu is supposed to be what? [laughs] Umfufi. Nah, it's… Nompumelelo Dube. I must have heard you say that a million times this week. Did I get it right? Nompumelelo. Nom-pume-le-lo Du-be. Can I just call you that? Ain't nobody from around here that's gonna say that full name. Lelo? Yeah. What? It's just my dad used to call me that, only him. That's what I'll call you then. [car horns blaring] What's it mean, your name? It means "success." [scoffs] Well, your parents definitely named you right. I see you out here auditioning, never giving up. It's girls like you that's gonna make it out here. Must be some self-fulfilling prophecy shit or something. Thanks. So, must be great growing up, having that as a name. [Nompumelelo] Well, "Jaquan" is, um… -Yeah? -…it has a… -What? -It's got a French thing. -Yeah, exactly. -[laughing] -[Jaquan sighs] -Oh, crap. What? -I keep forgetting my metro card. -Hold on. That's cool. I probably have one, somewhere. What will you use? [Jaquan] I probably got some in here somewhere, so… That's cool, keep it. Thank you. My bags. My bags. [scoffs] Yeah, your bags. My fault, I'm sorry, you know. Yeah, your bags, of course. Your bags. -[laughs] -All right? All right, just trying to run. Thanks again for everything. I'll see you at the next auditions. Thank you. Hey, Lelo. Y'all got Facebook over there in the jungle? The jungle. Um, yes, we do need a hamster spinning around in a wheel to get it, but we do. -[Jaquan] All right, then. -Cool. Hey, Jaquan? Um… could you rather just text me instead? I'm laying low on social media for a while. Cos you're some type of fugitive or something? Hey, that travel ban is no joke. All right then. What's your number? Um… Plaza 2-7… 8-3. [phone buzzes, chimes] [upbeat music playing] [doorbell rings] [woman] Hi, you must be Nomo… -[Nompumelelo] Lelo. Jess Feinstein? -[Jess] Yes. -[Nompumelelo] Nice to meet you. -And this is little Gabby. Say hello to Lelo, Gabby. I'm sorry, she's just a little tired. Please, come in. Wow. Your place is gorgeous. [Jess] Why, thank you so much. We just had it redone to accommodate this little one. [Nompumelelo] Wow, how old is she? Oh, she'll be one in a few months. Won't you, baby? [Nompumelelo] She is beautiful. David, she's here. [David] Just a second. [softly] Oh, that's what you said 20 minutes ago. I'm so glad that you could fill in on such short notice. Hubby and I have got this thing happening in the city. Well, I'm new to the city, and I really, I… I need the work, so… -[baby fussing] -Oh, I'm so glad. [making baby talk] OK, no television while we're away. No eating of the food. No leaving before or after David and me. David's my husband, who you'll hopefully meet sometime this year. David, I'm serious. You're being rude! All right, I'm here. Keep your pants on. -Hi. David. -Lelo. Nice to meet you. Nice… Nice to meet you. Wow, that's a nice accent. Where are you from? -South Africa. -No kidding? We were just talking about going there. Baby, weren't we always sayin'…? Yes, yes, yes, we were. Uh, no visitors, and no using of your cell phone while looking after the baby. And you can sleep in the guest room. It's $400 a week, but you're gonna have to buy your own groceries. -[baby coos] -Oh, hello. South Africa, huh? Where, exactly? Johannesburg. I see. That's like the major city over there. I can hear from your accent you went to a good school and all that. -Thanks. -David, focus. Yes, dear. So, uh, you have a work visa? I don't. But I'm… I'm extremely hard working. I'm great with kids. I'm reliable, I'm trustworthy. Well, uh… I like your look. Let's see how this goes. Myself and David are gonna be here for another hour, so we'll take it from there? Great, great. OK then, well, follow me to the nursery. Come on. -[water splashing] -[Nompumelelo making baby talk] [baby giggling] [baby talk continues] -[phone buzzes, chimes] -[knock on door] [knock on door] Hey. Wow. You look beautiful. -Thank you. -Like royalty. Oh, you didn't know? I'm the queen of Zamunda. [laughs] Coming to America. I love that movie. "Sex and chocolate, everybody!" [laughing] Sex and chocolate! Man, Africa is starting to sound more and more like here every time I talk to you. What did you think it was like? I don't know. So, what you trying to do now? Whatever you like. [both laugh] What you wanna eat? Whatever kind of food you like. Hop on two feet. [Nompumelelo laughs] -Make a pigeon sound. -[Nompumelelo coos] -Whoo! -[jogger] Oh. [Jaquan] Watch it, motherfucker! Yeah, I'm sorry. It's OK. [Jaquan sighs] Wanna get something to eat? Yeah, sure, what were you thinking? Um… I mean, you know, around here we eat burgers and shit, but if you want some flies or beetles… -Ha ha! -…or insects, I'm pretty sure we can… [Nompumelelo] Stay cool. That fame back home is the dream. Actually think that's the reason I'm all the way out here. [Jaquan] When you think you're going back? Till it's me all those people are paying to see. [Jaquan] Yes. [Nompumelelo] Auditioning is tough, but actually saying my name on a legitimate Broadway stage, that… that's really the dream. [Jaquan] Wow. Must be nice. What? Having a name like "success" and already making it happen for yourself. I'm jealous. Why don't you do the same? I can't sing. [both laugh] Was that the dream? Nah. Nah, I was going to be a director. I was gonna go to school, direct plays and shit. You know? But I got sent away. Got sent away? What's this "sent away"? What did you do? What makes you assume I did anything? -Sorry, I just, I… -Don't. I'm sorry, I… No, look, I'm sorry. [sighs] Still a sore spot, I guess. Some white lady thought I attacked her. Identified me and everything. Did… Did she know you before she identified you? What…? It was a misunderstanding, that's all. The judge didn't think so. First-time offense, I spent time in juvie. Couldn't get it expunged. No college would accept me after that. So now I direct actors to the back of the queue and assholes to the back of their seats. You should come to South Africa. -Seriously? -Seriously. Come on, me with a bunch of wild Africans singing "Hakuna Matata" all day? Yeah, I'll pass. [laughs] Hey, I watch a bunch of Yankees singing "New York, New York" every day. Sometimes you just have to go as far away as possible to make things happen for yourself. Nah… Africa? You're not a convicted criminal, so of course you can go wherever. But once you're in that system… that shit follows you everywhere. Besides, what's a guy like me gonna do in Africa? That's your home. Do you feel at home here, though? Tonight… yeah. Sorry I'm late. -Look at you. -Maybe I should turn in. Wait, I got you something. He did what? I loved it when I was younger. It has musicians from your country and it's amazing. I saw it today and thought of you. No, don't tell me to calm down. That white bastard tried to rape you. See, just put it on, and… -[Gracelandalbum playing] -…Bob's your uncle. Nice, huh? It didn't get that far. Kind of makes you… Now, it could have. [David] Don't you wanna, you know… He didn't. I'm OK, all right? Just leave it, just calm down. Everybody's watching. I'm sorry. I can't tell you how much that shit pisses me off. [Nompumelelo] I can tell. Right, and it would be him. It's an Upper West Side cracker, all this money, think he own shit. You said his wife was black, right? Yeah, that makes sense. [Nompumelelo] How? [Jaquan] Because this is literally history right now. It's slavery all over again. He's got this nigga wife and this African in his home and he starts thinking like his granddaddy's granddad where he can do whatever he wants. And you know what? He can. Tell me, are you gonna stop him? Hell, there's one who thinks just like him in the White House. So, what's the point? You said you wanted to be African-American? Well, welcome to it. This here's our fucking circle of life. Can't be that bad. Nah, you and everybody else laugh at us all day long, making fun of our culture, the way we talk and our name, but this is what we go through on the regular. This is how we got here. It's the world we live in. And even when they put us in charge, we get shot at or put away because we still living on the damn plantation. Can't tell me we ain't pickin' cotton no more. Shit, you lucky. Cos you get to go back. But the rest of us… I can't. [Jaquan] What? I can't go back. [Jaquan] Why? What you mean? I don't know much about your country, but I know you guys don't got like no war or famine going on or something like that. And you're always talking about how home ain't that much different from the city, right? You ain't gotta be here. I burnt all my bridges. It's not that I won't go back, I… I cannot go back. Wanna talk about it? Look, Lelo… I don't know what brought you here… and I don't know why you're here… but I'm glad that you are. Whatever you need… I got you. [utensils clattering] -Oh, you're up. -[Jess] Good morning. Good morning. I made breakfast. [Jess] Well, uh… thank you. Uh, I can take it from here. Is everything OK? [Jess inhales deeply] [Jess] Um… we won't be requiring your services anymore. Please pack your belongings and get outta the house. Did I do something wrong? [Jess sighs] [Jess] You know what you did. I don't. [Jess] David said he found this in your room. He said that? Jess, I didn't want to be the one to tell you this, but Dave made a pass at me, and when I rejected him, he decided to concoct this… disgusting lie! Jess, you have to believe me, please. I did nothing wrong. I need you to get out of my house. Get out. You happy now? Hi, Jaquan. Can you please call me when you get this? [motorcycle revving loudly] -[Jaquan] Wow. -[Nompumelelo] Yeah. Yeah, I was thinking like you needed a place to stay or some shit, but this? I can't go home, Jaq. I can pay you. What did you say? It's not much, but I've been saving and… it's yours. -What? -Only for a year. Just until I get my green card. Just… give me a minute. All right? [sighs] "Man, don't get mixed up with them African girls." "That's exactly what they do." "You think they're feeling you like that? They ain't feeling you like that, nigga." "Man, what? They're only after them papers." You know, that's another reputation you guys got here. [scoffs] And I'm supposed to act like I'm not seeing this right now, like… It's just for a year. Just until I get my green card, then I'll stop being Mrs. Griffin. If you want me to. Mrs. Griffin. Nompumelelo Griffin. It's not bad, huh? Sure about this? [woman in IsiZulu] Nompumelelo, my child, from today you're no longer a Dube. You're not a little girl anymore. From today, Nompumelelo, you're a woman. You see all these girls out there? All those girls out there want to be in your position. Which is why you need to respect it and take care of it. They treat me like I'm going to get epilepsies and cancer and die. What? Epilepsy? Yeah, man. [woman in IsiZulu] The man is the only authority in the home. There are not multiple authorities. [woman in English] The marriage is quick and painless, however… once you've obtained a license, there are a number of forms you would need to fill in for a petition for a change of immigration status. Do you, Nom… Nom… Nom… Nompumelelo Nqobile Dube. [woman] …take Jaquan Amari Griffin as your lawfully wedded husband? [woman 2] There is an interview with a government representative two to three months after the petition has been filed. All right, Mr. Griffin. What is Nompumelelo's favorite color? Where was she born? Pretty sure it's a place in South Africa. What color is her toothbrush? You sure about the questions? Yes, Adwoa and them briefed me before I came. Uh, blue. Uh, he doesn't know his father. Yellow. Jeremy's older. It's OK if we say you don't know. I don't know. Mm-hmm. If by any chance it is found that the marriage is fraudulent, you will be fined $250,000 and you will be immediately deported. This whole thing will cost you $2,000. Um… can you give us a second? [woman] Yeah, sure. [Jaquan] This is my spot. Well, make yourself at home. [Jaquan sighs] We can't do this. -No. -I may have a thousand dollars. I got the rest in savings. Promise to pay me back and it's yours. You sure this ain't just some green card thing? Hey… You're now called Lelo, remember? I do. I do. Lelo Griffin. Queens, New York. And I'm auditioning for the role of Doloris. [sighs] Hmm-mnh-mnh! No, Jaquan. What's this? Umdogo. It's porridge that I got at that store on Christopher. Couldn't believe they had it. Try. What do you think? It's OK. You're not staying? Can't. About a day late in auditions. You should come. Got a good feeling about this one. Ever heard of Aida? Mm-hmm. I saw it. Oh, yeah? You know, um, with my dad when… I don't know. Yeah, well, you got an advantage over your competition today. It's set in Africa. You know, a slave girl who falls in love with the capturer's son. But this ain't no "Hakuna Matata" shit, a'ight? Can't just be… [falsetto whining] Gotta dig deep. OK. I'm prepared. Let me hear you. -You're my director now? -No, your bill collector.

I actually did it. I made it… You mean we did it. Right? Remember, none of this would have been possible if it wasn't for me. Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah. Uh… I need to call my mom. [line ringing] [mother] Hello. Ma. Ma, I did it. I made it on to Broadway. I'm in Aida. OK, I'm in the chorus, but I made it. Ma, I'm on Broadway! [mother in IsiZulu] That's nice. Oh, Ma… Exactly who do you think is keeping you out of jail? Exactly who do you think is paying back the money you stole? I've been lying to the authorities, telling them that I'll pay it off. I've sold off whatever I had to keep you out of trouble. I think I've been supportive enough. Bye-bye. [phone beeps] [dialing tones] -[line ringing] -[sighs] [in English] Tumelo, she made it… [in IsiZulu] …onto Broadway in Aida. This mad girl is on Broadway. Maybe her father… Maybe all she needed was our support. Uh… sorry, I have to go, Mama. -Tumelo. -I'll give you a call later. -[dial tone beeps] -[Phindi] So… who was that? That was Mpumi's mom. Apparently she made it onto Broadway. What? Is that where she is? Uh-uh, I'm sorry. I'm contacting the authorities immediately. No, don't do that, Phindi, please. Tumelo, she's out here with stolen funds. Tumelo, everyone wants her ass dead or alive, and I really believe, in this situation, I do not have a choice. Phindi, if you do that, I'll never tell you anything ever again. And you're still covering for her. Tumelo… You know… I never used to understand what you saw in her. So… for years, I just watched as she took you for granted. Putting you on hold. But now… now I think I'm actually starting to understand what you two have in common. You both don't know how to recognize a good thing when it's right under your nose. Tumelo, I've always belonged to you. I know that she's known that. And… I just thought this could be our clean break with everything we've been talking about and how we both feel… Babe? -Tumelo. -Baby, I'm listening, I'm listening. Uh… Tumelo… Oh, my God… Can you please just be here for once? I am listening, Phindile. Yeah… sure. -[man] Yes, Nompi? -It's Nompumelelo. Never mind. Um… I was wondering if… -If? -If… You really think… you can be Aida? I've been working really hard. Look, sweetie, I'm gonna save you years. I'm sure back home in Zimbabwe, you're hot shit. Here in New York, you're a chorus girl. You're a chorus girl. You can hold a tune, you don't look bad in a background, but… you're a chorus girl. Steve, I'm good. I know I am. -Baby. -[bags clatter] [phone buzzing] Who's Hubby? What? Your phone. It was just ringing right now. You married or something, Lelo? Technically no. It's a traditional thing. It's not even legal. So technically you're married to two men. Jaquan… I was nothing more than a means to an end, was I? [Nompumelelo] It's not like that. You're lying. You know that? You're a liar and you're a fraud. You used me. That's not what… -That's not what it is. -That's exactly what it is. I can't believe I let myself fall for this shit. I mean, damn! Look at you… fresh off the boat, already making more money than I ever had in my whole life, and you used me for a green card. Your husband know about this? Hmm-mm. Tumelo knows nothing about it. So he don't know that his wife fucked her way to become an American, lied and cheated her way to get on Broadway? OK, I wasn't as honest as I needed to be, but I worked hard and I deserved this role. What fucking role?! You sing background for a few months. You think you're some star or some shit?! You're nothing, you monkey-bitch! Any success you have you owe to me. I owe you nothing but money! [muffled sound of crowd clamoring] [spoon rapping dish] Surprise. Bet you didn't think I was watching when you made this, but… ta-da! How is your eye? Lelo, I really am sorry. I know there's no excuse for what I did. I… [knock on door] [Nompumelelo] Who is it? [Adwoa] You beat me now! Yeah! I saved two months for this show! [clapping rhythmically] You were brilliant! You should have seen yourself on stage! Ha! Hey. Hey. I did not think it would happen so… so soon. What? [Adwoa] The green card black eye. [Nompumelelo] I owe you nothing but money! Did you even see me? [Adwoa] Of course I did. You were very good, very distinctive. Very distinct. [Nompumelelo] That's kind of you to say. [Adwoa] It's true, Nom. You were really good. You're kind. That's what my father would have said. He was kind, too. Just like the man that gave me this blue eye. -Come on. -Because I let him down. Don't worry yourself. -It's gonna be OK. -[knock on door] [Jaquan] Hey. Want me to walk you home? Oh, God. Please forgive me. Tumi, Tumi… Tumi. [Tumelo] What happened to you? -Who is this? -Jaquan Griffin. I'm her husband. -Oh, you're her husband? -[Nompumelelo] No! [Jaquan] Stop. Mpumi, let's go home. Let's go home, please. Lelo. Is this worth it? Look me in the eyes and tell me that this is worth it. Please. -Let's go home, let's go home. -[whimpering] I don't know. [whimpering] Let's go home. [Tumelo] Please. [Steven] Yes, come in. What can I do for you? Hi. Uh, Steve. I'm leaving. I'm going back to South Africa. Lelo, what are you talking about? I can't stay here, Steven. [Steven] Is this about our last conversation? [paper crinkling] Divorced? I see. Found what you needed, so you out, huh? No longer any use to you. [Jaquan sighs] Lelo… please, I'm sorry. You're the best thing that I have in my life right now, and I know I'll never say it right, but… Please. Jaquan. I'm sorry. I should never have put you in this position. Thank you. I never said it enough, but thank you. I'm gonna sleep at a hotel tonight. [Steven] Look, Lelo, I can't force you to stay. I will say, if you walk out now, you're never gonna work in this town again. Thank you again for everything. [mouthing words] [jet engines roaring] [phone buzzing and chiming] Ma. [Nompumelelo in IsiZulu] I can bail myself out, but my money is in dollars. [woman in IsiZulu] Why would we need your dollars? [woman in IsiZulu] You are free to go. Your husband has paid your bail. -[Nompumelelo in IsiZulu] Who? Tumelo? -Yes, I think that's his name. -Has he left? -Yes, he has. If you need to convert your cash, there's the bureau de change at Terminal B. [in English] Thanks. Um, I'll have to call you back. Shut the door. [package crinkling] Um… I couldn't do a transfer cos my accounts were frozen, and it's… 60,000 dollars… I mean rands, sorry. Your mother paid back about 10,000 rand of this. But we'll consider it as interest. [man on radio] Really came out of nowhere. I didn't know the Grammys were being announced. Like I found out in the morning. A friend texted me, "Wow, dude, Grammy Award, so exciting!" And I was like, "Did we get invited? Oh, snap!" -Second mezzanine, here we come! -[audience laughs] I'm not gonna lie, with most things in life I can be humble… [announcer] Zozibini Tunzi is in her hometown today to continue her homecoming celebration. She arrived at O.R. Tambo International Airport yesterday, her first time on home soil since winning the Miss Universe crown. Our reporters… [knock on door] I had to find out. -Find out what, Mpumi? -Don't raise your voice at me. [Tumelo] Find out what? If I could do it, and I could. You let me. Excuse me? What? [Nompumelelo] I'm not blaming you. I messed up. And I hurt a lot of people. But let's get real, Tumelo. Your wife was unhappy. She skipped the country, the police were looking for her, and you stayed behind and you fucked her best friend. What are you saying, Mpumi? Fine, I am a crap wife. But what were we thinking? Were either of us ready for marriage, Tumelo? Did either of us know what it means to take someone as their partner? How could I have been happy with someone I can't even talk to, someone who can't even stand the sound of my own voice? Oh, so you decided to move to the States and marry someone else, huh? I needed a green card, and you moved on with Phindi. So it's my fault now, Mpumi? Maybe I shouldn't have come. I just wanted to say that I love you, Tumelo. Not as my buddy, but as my… as my husband. You're being unrealistic, Mpumi. [Nompumelelo] Fine, but I'm your wife. And if I'm your wife and I'm sorry… I'm terribly sorry… then it's your job to forgive me. New York was unrealistic, but this… this is marriage. I'm sorry, Tumelo. Please forgive me. [Phindi] My love, who are you talking to? I'll leave.
