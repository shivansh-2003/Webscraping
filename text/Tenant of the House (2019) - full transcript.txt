You look quite exquisite. -I know. -[Sam chuckles] Saw your eyes piercing through me earlier. Well, it's a good thing [chuckles] that you're here. I've actually been looking forward to… to have the opportunity to… [chuckles] [man1] Lizzy! Oh. Hi, sweetie! [laughs] -Excuse me. -What are you doing with him, anyway? Look, I rub his belly and he gives me plenty money. [Lizzy happily] Hi! Darling! [laughs] ‪-[man1] Hello.‬ ‪-[Lizzy] Are you missing me?‬ ‪[Lizzy giggles]‬ -[male voice] Man! -[Samuel] Hello? [in Hausa] Um, I'm at a party. -I'll call you when I'm done. -[Honorable member singing] -Yes, I understand-- -[Honorable member] The patriot! Honorable Samuel, what are you doing here alone? [Honorable member] Everybody is inside sharing large bags of money. [Samuel] Now be careful, Honorable. Not everyone would believe that you're joking. Anyway, forget it. Um… who was that guy with Lizzy Bello? [Samuel] Apparently, she rubs his stomach and he showers her with affection. [laughs] Let her come and rub my stomach, too, then. [chuckles] Come… what is this rumor that I'm hearing that you want to be on the oversight function to Kaduna state? Wow. Now, news travels fast in the House. I'm sure you've heard about the land dispute between Nabardo and Zukuri. Yeah, those two towns? Or should I say those two clowns? They're always fighting. So far, the death count is 117 people! We need to put a stop to it. Besides, it's my home state. Oh boy. You just have to take your time. Be very careful. There's no money to be made in doing oversight functions. You will just go there and come back with an empty… pocket. [Samuel] Honorable, you sometimes talk as if you don't get paid a salary. Is it that small allowance that they give to us that you call a salary? Still, some people believe we get paid much as it is. They should come and see how we're coping. Anyway… there is this rumor going round that the honorable Speaker is about to slip on a banana peel. [soft tense music playing] ‪[light traffic sounds]‬ ‪[zipper opening]‬ ‪[zipper closing]‬ [grunts] That's 200,000 dollars. And from where that came from, there's much more. You have been privileged to be included in the caucus. Your main role is to be the think tank in the Speaker's impeachment. [Samuel] Remember that statement I made earlier about earning the prefix, "Honorable"? It's times like this that I backslid. Looking back now, I can see how they ensnared me. If you take your eye off the ball, there's a very good chance you'll end up scoring an "own-goal." I took my eye off the ball. I'm in. [both laugh] A toast? [Lizzy laughs] ‪-[man] Great.‬ ‪-[Lizzy] Welcome.‬ -[man] Welcome. -[Lizzy laughs] [man laughs] You made the right choice. [laughs] [soft tense music playing] [man chuckles] Was the Honorable Samuel Bakura pleased? -[Samuel] Very well pleased, indeed. -[laughs] ‪I hope I didn't let‬ the Honorable Elizabeth Bello down. [chuckles] No complaints there. Especially the thing you did with your tongue. Where did you learn how to do that? [chuckles] On the farm. [both laugh] [laughs][grunts] Yeah. ‪-[Lizzy sighs]‬ ‪-[Samuel groans]‬ -The stakes are high, Sam. -[groans] We've got to strike against the Speaker imminently. So fast? We strike whilst the iron is still hot. Whilst we still have interests aligned. Twenty four hours in politics, is a very long time. Remind me, please. Why exactly are we impeaching the Speaker? Speaker Attah… has stepped on certain big toes in the cabal. Is that all? [grunts] Patience, my dear. Horse before the cart? I thought I was in. [Lizzie sighs] Look, you're a part of the caucus with supervised... restrictions. Hmm? You need to learn to trust me. [grunts] Look, you know what I once heard here in Abuja? That the greatest loyalty a woman can give to a man is by opening wide her legs. [chuckles, laughs] That advice has served me well. [man] I told you! -[man laughs] -[Lizzy laughs] -[Lizzy] Yes. -[man] Thank you. -Distinguished Senator. -[senator] Yeah. [Lizzy laughs] [senator] Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, you're welcome to Senator Kayode Smollet's office. -Thank you very much. Thank you. -Yes. -It's good to have every one of you here. -Thank you. And thank you for having us. -[all laugh] -Thank you. You see, just like I was telling you, it was just a matter of time before the Speaker was brought to his knees. He's already desperately reaching out to Senator here. [laughs] That's a good development, you know. Speaker Attah will feel the effect of a slippery banana peel under his shoes. [all laugh] -And the cabal will be pleased. -[senator, Lizzy] Yes. -Wenike. -[Wenike] Yes, please. ‪[very softly]‬ ‪Have you given him the money?‬ [Wenike] I'm just definitely… ‪[Lizzy] Samuel, what is this I'm hearing?‬ That you're taking an oversight trip? Yes. Next week. ‪What for?‬ You can't go. You're needed here in Abuja. Why? The caucus needs you here. All of our politicking is about to go down and we need you to stay on point. What is going down? I can't say it yet. You can't say it? Then I'm leaving town. No! [man] In my opinion, a worker that has done a good job for his master deserves commendation. -[laughs] -[Lizzy laughs] -Honorable Kasali, -Oh, yeah? Do you want me to personally pass on that request to the cabal? Ah, Arese. Can't you take a joke? [all laugh] Good day, gentlemen, Elizabeth. [Lizzy laughs] [Samuel] It was like being in a night club full of prostitutes while your doting wife awaits you at home. I knew I shouldn't be among them but I didn't know a way out yet. [soft tense music playing] ‪[footsteps]‬ [Samuel] They say that when one's path has been blurred, one should seek guidance from above. ‪[door opens]‬ ‪[footsteps]‬ Samuel. Mr. Speaker. I can't compete dollar for dollar with those who seek my downfall. But I'm hoping I can appeal to your intelligence and conscience in doing the right thing. You're a ship of potential. You shouldn't be camping with pigs. Please, join me in moving our country forward to save out nascent democracy from these hungry and dirty parts. Patriot, sometimes it pays to remember what brought us into politics in the first place. [door shuts] [voices shouting in distance] [boy in Hausa] Mama! Baba! [drums beating in distance] ‪[indistinct chatter]‬ ‪[indistinct protest]‬ [in Hausa] Go! Go! Go! [Samuel] I've changed my mind. Um, I'm out of play. What the hell do you think you're doing, Samuel? I mean Lizzy, look at the reason you're giving for Speaker Attah's impeachment. "He stepped on toes." So what? We all do. It's called politics. Don't you get it? Whatever he has done, as of the moment, does not warrant his impeachment. ‪[sighs]‬ Lizzy, you're not saying anything. Can you handle the truth? It's too late to quit now. There's no backing out. Do you think this is a game? The cabal doesn't hold prisoners. [in Hausa] Are you joking Samuel. Eh? Do you want to get killed? I've returned their money. ‪It's not about money,‬ ‪you sanctimonious clown.‬ The most prized currency in politics is loyalty. And I'm choosing to remain loyal to the Speaker. [sighs] Samuel, Samuel. [sighs] Sam… [laughs] Look, when my husband, the late Honorable Sanni Bello, passed away, have you ever wondered why they… they handed me his seat on a golden platter? I'm not from Kogi state. Neither am I a man. But here I am representing the most important constituency in the entire Kogi. And it's all because… my husband was loyal. He was loyal to the core. Look, they never forget, Samuel. You must watch your back. ‪[chuckles]‬ Samuel. [soft tense music playing] [knock on door] Who is it? [knock on door] -I said, who is it? -[Lizzy] It's Lizzy. [Lizzy] Are you going to close that door? -What do you want? -[Lizzy] I'm here to save you. How much did the Speaker give you? -He gave me back my liver. -And I vouched for you, Sam! I called you my brother in front of Honorable Wenike which is why he gave you privileged access to our resources and our secrets. The cabal will be furious! We're going to lose face in the House. And we'll lose influence. And thanks to you, a certain danger will loom over our heads from now on. You put us all at risk! [sighs] Sam. I like you. A lot. Which is why I'm giving you one last chance to come back to your senses. I've already made my decision, Lizzy. Don't you get it? I have. They won't be knocking at your door when they come for you, Sam. Don't say I didn't warn you. Lizzy. [soft tense music playing] If you're not from Kogi, where do you come from? I'm from everywhere… and I'm from nowhere. [whimpering] [drums beating] [panting] [men shouting] [man screaming] ‪[whimpering]‬ [man] I'm not supposed to tell you this, Samuel, but there have been efforts from certain groups to remove your name from the Land Reforms oversight committee. [Samuel] I see. [Speaker] By supporting me, you have thrown stones in some people's garri. But worry not. I have your back. [Samuel] Appreciated, Mr. Speaker. If I may ask though, why do you insist on being on a trip? There's no financial incentive to be gained from that oversight function. Then I must be doing it for other reasons bordering on civic responsibility. [chuckles] I can see that is why they nickname you, "The Patriot." [in Hausa] My hope is to have courageous people like you that will stand in the House. And, I won't say anything more, other than pray that God protects you on your trip. And I pray this trip you are embarking on will bring an end to this crisis. That's what is happening. -Okay. -That's good. Honorable Samuel Bakura. [in English] Uh… I know you. You were at uh, Honorable Smollet's office. Good evening. I am Arese Abulu. I run interference for the cabal. Interference? I clean up when others mess up. I made my decision clear to Honorable Elizabeth Bello. Make it clear to me. I remain loyal to the Speaker. But you were happy to set aside your principles and take the money. I returned the money. Refunded it to whom? [Samuel] The same person who informed you I was out. [Arese] Hmm. Moving ahead. What would it take to bring you back into play? You see, if I don't stand for something, I would definitely fall for anything. [Arese] Think carefully, Patriot. You may be backing the wrong horse. ‪Today's news, is tomorrow's toilet paper.‬ The Speaker is going down. I'll take my chances. If we discover you lied about returning the money... somebody's going to pay you a visit. It won't be a friendly visit. Have a good night, sir. [soft tense music playing] [gentle traditional string music playing] [man coughs] [Samuel] Yeah. [Samuel] Listen, this is the place. [man] Up? [Samuel] From here, down there. -[indistinct chatter] -[Samuel] Yeah. [Samuel] Just come. [Samuel] Come. [laughs] [Samuel] So… Is this it? You mean this is the borderline that there's been killing and fighting for over the past decade? I mean, the place is not even fertile. Um… come, Samuel. Are you sure these people have not secretly discovered oil in this place? Because as far as I'm concerned, this piece of barren land is not worth killing one another for. Right? In fact, the place is so barren. And there's no access to water, neither a lake or river within a hundred miles of the forsaken place. -You're right. -So what are they fighting over? You see, sometimes it's not about any particular thing -other than-- -Other than pride? You mean all these skirmishes are about pride? [Samuel] Hmm. [Samuel] It's not as simple as you think. You see, the Zukuris believe this land is theirs, passed on from their forefathers. ‪And when we get to Narbado,‬ ‪they would claim the same thing.‬ Well, that's simple. Then they should continue killing themselves. Let them continue killing themselves. Honorable, land is not something they joke with in these parts. [Samuel] They would rather cut off their right arm than to give it up. Please, I'm hungry. -Honorable, wait! You're not the only one. -Well, Honorable. [man] Ah, this must be some kind of joke. [gentle string music continues] [man grumbling] Fighting over this piece of barren land! [Samuel] Yeah. [in Hausa] Ah. Mom. [Samuel chuckles] [in Hausa] Welcome back. [laughs] Welcome back. [laughs] Here… [laughs] -How's everything? -I'm fine. How are you? How was work, mom? -How was your trip? -It was good. How is everyone? Come on, Samuel, so since you left home you haven't even checked up on us. I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry. -Okay. -So don't you know that's how politics is? One can forget his family just like that? [laughs] Oh, it's not like that. That's how it is in Abuja most times. Things are beyond my control. That's the nature of our work. But that's not a reason not to come see you. But I'm sorry. Look how skinny you look! Don't you eat food in Abuja? For God's sake, let's go in. I'll make you some food. -Welcome. -[laughs] Let me go inside. [in Hausa] What's up? [brother in Hausa] Brother, what brought you back? It's because of the issue about… That land dispute, honestly. Zukuri and Nabardo? Even two weeks ago, they had a very nasty clash. -A lot of people were injured. -Hmm. I thought that for you people in Abuja, what bothers us here does not affect you. It's not like that. It bothers me, too. Okay. What is happening now is that, as you know, there is a dispute over that land sitting between those two villages, Each party feels like the land belongs to them. The key to resolving this issue is to mediate peace between them. That's why I'm here. The first thing I'll do is to start with the Zukuri people. -Then, I'll go to the Nabardo people. -[in English] What?! Nabardo? [in Hausa] They're Fulani people! You know they're very troublesome. They can cut your neck open like they're slaying cattle. It's not like that. Don't forget that I'm not one of them. I'm neither from Zukuri nor from… um, the Nabardo tribe. In my opinion, God knows it's the Zukuri's that... I sympathize with. That's connected to my motherland. [in Hausa] But don't forget, I'm not representing my motherland. I'm for the Federal Government. I hear you. ‪[brother] Mom!‬ -[brother in Hausa] Mom! -[Samuel] Take this in for me. [in Hausa] There's nothing that will make us leave that land! Everything you see there being claimed by the Zukuri people, actually belongs to us. I swear everything that these Fulani people are doing, is for nothing! We will never leave this land! Even if the world comes to an end, we won't! Do you all understand? That's all. ‪[mouths] What did he say?‬ [gentle traditional string music playing] [indistinct chatter] [local music playing] [Samuel in English] She came out of nowhere. Like a rainbow after a rainfall. Like a bountiful harvest after a season of drought. Like a mirage in the middle of the desert. Was she merely a figment of my imagination? -Is this real? -[in Hausa] What did you say, sir? [in Hausa] Why did you sound like a Yoruba man? [man in Hausa] I'm a Yoruba man but I grew up in a Fulani town. [Samuel in Hausa] Really? [in Hausa] I'm so surprised seeing women here with radio. [man 3 in Hausa] All these women you see over there with radios, they're showing us that they're engaged to be married. If you look around this market now, you'll see some men holding things. They're carrying things. -Yes, I've seen them. -Yes, those things you see, [man in Hausa] on those men show us that they're also engaged. [Samuel] So they're showing us now that -this person is engaged, -Yes. -and that woman is engaged to be married. -Yes. The things you see on their head and the radios are symbols of love. [in English] We are here-- [in Fulani] Call me Badejo. ‪[indistinct chatter]‬ [lady in Hausa] Peace be unto you. [elders in Arabic] And also unto you. [in Fulani] Okay Badejo, sit down. [in Fulani] Please translate for us. [chief muttering in Fulani] [in Fulani] Badejo. [in Fulani] What brought them here? [in Fulani] Okay. [in English] He said, "What did you people say?" Um, um… Yeah, we're trying to tell them that the government is not happy with the frequent trouble between this town and Zukuri. Enough lives have been wasted. [in Fulani] He said the Government is not happy with the killings around here and that too many lives have been wasted. [in Fulani] Alright... [muttering in Fulani] [in English] He said, "That's good. So what do you want us to do?" Okay. Tell them that there's going to be a meeting coming up in Abuja next month. And we want them to send a representative, and someone who'll speak on their behalf. [in Fulani] He said there's going to be a meeting in Abuja. They want us to send delegates that will go there, to be our representatives in the dialogue. [muttering indistinctly] [in English] He said that, "Even if we went there, we would just keep fighting each other, so there's no need to go there." How so? He said that, "They know the land is ours, and when they fight us... we try to fight them back, they'll say we're killing them." They said that there's an elderly man in their village who always tells them that the land belongs to them. So they always claim that the land is not ours. It's their own. Well, excuse me, and with all due respect, elders. We have visited the stretch of the border land. And honestly speaking, to be candid with you, I cannot understand why you people are claiming ownership. I mean, this is a four kilometer barren piece of land. [in Fulani] He said they have visited the border land, which is about four kilometers away from us and he doesn't understand why -we're claiming that useless land. -[elders protest] [muttering in Fulani] [in Fulani] Alright, here it is. Please ask him, "What's the use, of your left leg toe?" [in English] He said that, "What is the function of your left leg toe?" I beg your pardon. It is my toe! [in Fulani] He said it's his. [in Fulani] Okay, ask him, "If it's cut off, will you be able to walk?" [in English] He said that, "If they removed the toe, would you be able to walk?" Well, yes. And so? [murmuring in Fulani] [murmuring in Fulani] [murmuring in Fulani] [elder in Fulani] Alright, Salihu. [in Fulani] Cut off his toe, -let's see! -[reps shout in protest] -[in English] What is all this?! -Honorable Bakura! -[men laughing] -[reps spluttering] Salihu? Bakura? [Chairman] Call this man off! [man laughs] [in Fulani] It's alright. [murmurs in Fulani] [in English] He said that, "As you love your useless toe, so do we love our barren land." Well, you could have made a point instead of all this. Just like that? He said that they have no problem attending the meeting with the Zukuri people in Abuja as long as they can lay claim on the land as their own. Is that the only way? [in Fulani] He asked if that's the only way? -[murmurs in Fulani] -[in English] He said yes. [Chairman] Gentlemen and Lady, this will go down in the annals of the House of Reps as the most boring oversight trip ever embarked upon. The issue we came here to resolve, has it been solved? ‪We never came here to solve it.‬ ‪This is merely a fact-finding mission.‬ What facts did we discover? Both Nabardo and Zukuri are not willing to compromise. Both communities will continue with the killing unabated. Finito! But did you see that mad chief? He threatened to cut off my toe. But he was just playing with you. Look, we got them to agree to come to Abuja. That is progress, if you ask me. Oh. Progress. You want them to turn the streets of Abuja into a war zone. What do you propose? We should allow them to continue killing each other? I'm not convinced that dialogue in Abuja is the solution. Look... the government should take a firm stance on this. Give the land to one of the communities and then back it up -with heavy presence of the police. -No, no. It won't work. It's like pitching the North against the core North. We have to resolve this dispute. We can't allow these skirmishes to go on. [Chairman] Samuel. Samuel. Do you think these people want a resolution to this problem? These people will continue fighting over a barren piece of land. Look, we're done here. Tomorrow morning, we return to Abuja. [reps] Yes! Yes! Hmm. This is better. Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'd like to stay back a few days. [reps] Huh? No, don't get me wrong. To conduct more findings. -Oh! Suit yourself. [laughs] -[teasing] More findings! No, research. [laughs] -More findings. -[Samuel laughs] [haunting flute music playing] [children shouting] [Samuel] You write good English. [Badejo] Thank you, sir. [Samuel] You're in what class? [Badejo] I'm no more in school. [Samuel] Why not? Why? I'm in preparation. Preparation for what? My marriage. But… but I've not seen you with your radio. I love books. Would you have liked to have continued schooling? If only cocks could grow teeth, or elephants fly. [Samuel] Hmm. Well. Your fiancé doesn't support you continuing with your education, right? Maybe. Maybe it is better we do not discuss such matters. Books, huh? [women chattering in Fulani] So… what is the Fulani name for flower? -[lady] Findi. -[Samuel] Indi? [with emphasis] Fin di. [Samuel] Findi. [Samuel laughs] You're not fulani. Yes. I'm bagi. -Ah. Bagi. -Hmm? Why are you helping us? ‪Must I be one of you to help you?‬ Hmm? You see, all conflicts need resolution. If I, as a member of the House, that truly represents the interest, aspirations and challenges of the people does not step forward, then who will? -You're a politician. -Meaning what? No offense intended. I only meant that you're quite eloquent in the manner you express yourself. [laughs] Okay, I will not have you arrested because you're slandering an honorable member of the house. Besides, I have personal reasons why I want the conflict, you know, to be resolved. Many years ago, I lost somebody that is very close to me during a similar conflict between two villages. Oh. Well, I'm sorry. But you were not around? [laughs] I was at the time but not anymore. I became a lawyer to resolve the conflict but you know, the court process is a slow grind. Yet the conflict continued. So I realized that I had to find a lasting solution. Hence, you became a politician. Hence, I became a politician. [laughs] [traditional string music continues] Who are those boys? It's Gidado. [Samuel] Gidado? Yes. My husband-to-be. Oh, which one is he? The one with the red scarf. -Your scarf, I believe? -Yes. -Greetings. -Greetings. So, how many cows did your parents ask Gidado to bring for your dowry? Eight, but he has five now. Hmm. If you return to Abuja, when are you coming back here? Very soon, I hope. You have a family in Abuja? Wife, children? Yes. I have a son. Here. Yeah. His name is Mark. Nine years old. You're not with his mother? Yeah. She passed away. Oh. I'm sorry. Yeah. It's been a long time. He now stays with my cousin in London where he schools. He looks very handsome. Like his father, huh? [both laugh] Umm, can you talk to your… I mean, can you... talk to Gidado so I can snap you together? -[sighs] -Hmm? -[in Fulani] Gidado! Come. -What? He said he wants to take our photograph. Guys, come! [in Hausa] Thank you. [traditional string music playing] [children singing] [Speaker in Hausa] Yes. In a short time, I'll get it. [mobile phone ringing] [in English] What do you people want from me? Where is Samuel Bakura? [yells] Where is Samuel Bakura? Good day, sir! Mr. Speaker sir! [reporter] How do you feel about the impeachment? [tense music playing] [clears throat] Watch! [Speaker] It is obvious that a certain cabal was never happy with my emergence as Speaker two years ago. They are prepared to do anything to impeach me by using some of our greedy and hungry colleagues. This is a democracy that was hard fought for. We would stand strong and not allow any person, regardless of power or status to truncate it. We would abide by the constitution and fully respect the separation of powers as a means of checks and balances on conduct. There will be no scared cows. And I assure you, whatever situation we find ourselves in, light will surely prevail over darkness. [in Yoruba] Is that all? I said, is that all? [in English] The cabal would have watched that. You people assured me that the Speaker was running scared. This sounds pretty confident to me. -Senator, he's just bluffing. -Yeah. He's just bluffing. You see, he can bluff in public… but in private, he knows that the tides have turned against him. -Yep. Absolutely. -He's merely bluffing. The Speaker is now afraid of his own shadow. And that is why he's been running to the media for cover. Everything is going according to plan, Senator. We are primed to strike. Senator, what is the problem? I have the Senate on lockdown. But the House of Reps is full of dissidents. I need to know. I repeat, I need to know that we won't encounter any resistance to the proposed amendment. -We're not encountering any resistance. -No. It's a deal. -It will sail through. -No. No, I don't think we are going to face any resistance. That's not what I hear. [Senator] That is not what I hear, Wenike. I hear the Speaker has a sizeable majority in the House of Reps to stop an impeachment against him. Oh, the people are only deceiving him. The odds are against him. ‪I need more proof.‬ I need more proof that he believes he will get impeached. We have the figures. What are we waiting for? Hey! Stop it! Elizabeth, stop it! Stop it! I said, stop it! Don't bullshit a bullshitter. You're talking about having numbers. Elizabeth, you keep talking about having numbers. With all your assets, and ass-ets... you couldn't even keep Samuel Bakura in line. [in Yoruba] Oh, what a pity! See, I am not going to allow the cabal to be rubbished. There is too much at stake. Okay? Reconfirm your numbers, then I make the call. [soft dramatic music playing] [tense music playing] [Samuel] While the game of power continued in Abuja, I focused on my task at hand. If I was going to resolve the clashes between Nabardo and Zukuri, I needed to weed out the problems that posed as obstacles in the way. [in Hausa] Sam, look. It's not necessary, that's what you're telling me, to become a hero and win a war? But the part you played in the war, is what will determine your success. So you must be mindful of the part you will play. Do you understand me? Look, if you carry a stone like this and throw it, wherever it reaches, that's the extent of your power. -Do you understand me? -Yes. ‪One day, someone will come and‬ ‪see that stone of yours,‬ pick it up and throw it even further. If that happens, ‪you'd have played‬ ‪your own part and so would he. Right?‬ -That's right. -Good! Okay, let's eat now! [laughs] [drums beating gently] [in Hausa] Brother. [in Fulani] Hey. [brother grunts] [Samuel in Hausa] Hello. [in Hausa] Of course, a person can be separated from his land. But nobody can separate or remove the love in someone's heart for his land. That's right. You are also a person that's proud of his land. If I'm not proud of my land, what will I be proud of? I have nothing as important as my land. -[brother hisses] -[Samuel sighs] I truly miss him. And you, I thank you. You're thanking me? -[in English] Thanking me? -[in Hausa] For looking after Mom. [in Hausa] Sacrificing your dream of joining the Army. Since dad died, you've been taking care of her. Maybe if you had not done that, this farm we are proud of would have been lost. Maybe I would not even have a house where I could come visit. Because of that, I would never forget your sacrifice. [music] [Lizzy] Mr. Speaker. What is it you want? [Speaker] You people have me by the balls. You've done the math? ‪I don't know how you did it, Lizzy,‬ but somehow you have won over enough members of the house to trigger a successful impeachment against me. You know what your problem is, Attah? Despite being the Speaker, you have no clue, none whatsoever when it comes to politics and how it's played around here. And that is why I'm reaching out to you, dear Elizabeth. Is there a soft landing? A cushion? Someway I can avoid this... predicament? [gentle music playing] [mobile phone ringing] Hello, Maria. [Maria] Hello, Sam. ‪How are you?‬ It's about Mark. He was rushed to the hospital early this morning. What? What's that? What's wrong with him? He has appendicitis and needs surgery. Oh my God. What? A nine-year old? Maria, isn't there something that can be done instead of surgery? Um, um, I should be there right now. You know what, Maria? -I'll catch the flight to London first-- -Sam, don't worry, ‪-thing in the morning.‬ ‎-You don't have to come here. -No, I have to be there. -Everything will be taken care of. Nothing can be more important than my son. So I'm coming. Yeah. Um, Maria, I'll call you back. [hesitates] Hello, Mr. Speaker. [gentle music playing] -[indistinct chatter] -[laughs] [Speaker in Hausa] Lizzy, how are you? [laughs] Samuel! I'm glad you made it on such short notice. How was your trip? Um… encouraging and enlightening but a lot of work has to be done. What is going on here? I needed you while you were away. I'm sorry. There was a lot to be done over there. My back was against the wall. I had to fall on my sword. Mr. Speaker, what do you mean? They had the numbers to impeach me. [Samuel] That's impossible! In politics, anything is possible. So-called loyalists were smiling at my face but pushing the dagger in deeply behind my back. But you said they had the numbers. The threat of impeachment is now gone. It's a good thing, right? Yea, but it has come at a most heavy price. So why are we all gathered here? [Senator] Hello, everyone. Please gather around. Please come around quickly. Thank you so very much. I welcome you all and I thank you for coming. As you all know why we're all here, um, Wenike, it's all about this constitutional amendment. Now, there is a need for us to amend the constitution. Am I right? Right. So that we can stay for the third term to complete our ongoing projects. And unto this purpose, it would be your job to push the proposed constitutional amendment through legislature. And I hope, or let me say, we hope, we can count on your support. Right? Right. -Samuel, are you okay? -Should I be? What's the problem? You mean, apart from the fact that we've just been hoodwinked into prolonging the executive's term in office. -Come on, Samuel. -No, no. I can't deal with this right now. My cousin in the UK called. [Samuel] My son is admitted. Awaiting to undergo surgery. -I'm very sorry about that. -I fly out tomorrow. [Speaker] Yes, you should. When you are back, we will talk. You know, you don't have to play me like that, Sam. -Not everyone has a price. -[laughs] So you still think it's about the money. Well you're wrong. Look at him. [Lizzy] See that? The man you were so loyal to. You know, we made him an offer… that he could have refused, but he didn't. We're making history here, Sam, and I would really, really want you to be a part of it. I've got to go. [gentle music playing] [Samuel] I spent the next two weeks in London with my son. Mark's operation and recuperation went well. The whole time I was away, politics was the furthest thing from my mind. But I did think of that angel. Quite often, indeed. [Speaker] Come on, Samuel. What is the matter with you? You're supposed to be my loyalist. [in Hausa] Do you understand what this word means? When I walk, you walk. When I eat, you eat. When I shit, you shit. You embarrassed me on the floor of the House today. Just because I raised a motion? Your motion called for a breakdown of a constitutional amendment. But we're supposed to break down any amendment as long as it involves more than one change. Samuel. Oh, I get it. You're trying to sneak in the tenure elongation into the bill through the back door, right? [in Hausa] The tenure elongation is good. [in Hausa] Did anyone tells you it's not good? It's good! [in English] It is so shocking and painful, sir, that just two weeks ago, you and I were on the same side fighting a common noble cause as worthy comrades. I can now understand that the impeachment threat against you was designed to bring you into, into line on the constitutional amendment. [chuckles] Samuel, in politics there are no permanent friends or enemies. Just permanent interests. Does being a Speaker really mean that much to you? You could have just told the cabal to take a jump and maintain your dignity. Instead, you sold out! [in Hausa] Nobody can say he's the only one that can do what others cannot do. [in English] You can't operate without belonging to a caucus. Everybody has a price tag, Samuel. -Not me, sir. -Really? [in Hausa] I know how worried you are. Because of the dispute at the border in Kaduna I want you to know that we have the power to invite them The Nabardo and Zukuri people They will come to Abuja in two weeks. [in Hausa] And I also want you to know we have the power to continue this fight from now till one year's time. Samuel, play ball. Be a winner. Hmm? [gentle music playing] Look who's here! Oh. [chuckles] [Samuel chuckles] Are you buying that for your girlfriend? For my brother's wife. Does your brother know you're buying his wife perfume? Get your mind out of the gutter, Lizzy. You stayed back for a few days in Kaduna, after your committee left. [sighs] So I can't visit my family anymore? Besides, it gave me a chance to actually find out a few more facts about the conflict over there. This land they're fighting over, what does it look like? Just a barren stretch. I took some photos of it. [Lizzy] Let's see. Oh, interesting. That was some performance you put up on the floor of the House, Samuel. -[chuckles] -A loyalist won against the caucus. The look on Attah's face when you stabbed him in the back was almost like a Shakespearean tragedy. "Et tu, Samuel?" The Speaker knew I wasn't on board. Hmm, I see. Samuel the Patriot. You know, I… I almost admire you for your convictions, as much as I loathe you for your naivete. Whatever, Lizzy. So anyway, who are these people? [spluttering] Oh, um… Some villagers. Really? If I were you, Samuel, I would watch my maneuvers in the House. A lone wolf can be easily pulled down. Mavericks don't last very long in politics of the land especially here in Nigeria. -Oh. -See, I've got to pay for these items. Do have a great day. Yeah. [gentle music playing] [senator on TV] eradicate polio, malaria, cholera, and many other diseases. On the area of manpower development in the health sector, we re-incorporated the services of environmental health workers in Mogali with a view to making them more functional… [knock on door] [senator on TV] In this regard, one-family-use were employed to implement and sustain the program… [persistent knock on door] [Samuel] Lizzy. Again. See, you've got to stop showing up here ‪and just walking in‬ ‪like you're the one paying my rent.‬ What, now? What's really going on with us Sam? [sighs] -We're good colleagues. -Really? And have you been a good colleague to me? Come and eat. After all I did for you. How could you just leave me in the cold? I mean, you've made me lose influence because you bailed out on the caucus. I'm really sorry for that. I didn't mean to cause you any problems. Maybe I'd have acted differently back then if I knew half of what I know now. Looks like everyone has a price. Except you, Sam. Look, politics aside, we seem to get along quite well, don't we? Of course, we do. Okay. So… obviously since we're both not on the same wavelength where politics is concerned. Let's try something, like a relationship. Look at you. Grown man, living by yourself. Eating noodles? Hey! I happen to like noodles. Look, Sam, what I'm trying to say is… you need someone in your life. You need a woman who can add some value, bring some bounce to it. Um, well, that can come later. Why don't we start now? Let's do something… normal. You know, maybe a relationship? Go out, catch a movie. Have dinner. How about we have dinner tomorrow night. I have to decline. I've got things to do. ‪Okay. Things like what?‬ [sighs] The land reforms committee is hosting the leaders of Zukuri and Nabardo here in Abuja shortly. As the coordinator, I have to go back to the communities to liaise. What has that got to do with you and I having dinner tomorrow? I'm travelling tomorrow. But shifting it one day would not change anything, Sam. If I don't go tomorrow, Lizzy, I might miss the chance of meeting with some key people involved. You know what? All I'm hearing is you're rushing off to meet some rustic Fulani girl. Okay. Straight up. I did meet this woman that I'm attracted to. But she's not the reason I'm going. I see. Do you love her? I'm still getting to know her? Does she love you? Does she love you the way I do? Lizzy, I'm already into her. Okay. -Look, Sam, just-- -No, no. [sighs] You know what, Sam? I just hope you're not giving up what we have… for some stupid goatherd's daughter. I'm really into her, Liz. Okay. [sighs] [soft music playing] [door slams] ‪[voice on TV]‬ ‎…environmental health planners… [clears throat] [sighs] [in Hausa] Brother what's the discussion you don't want to have inside? That you insisted we should come outside. Yes it's because I didn't want mom to hear us. Okay. I'm listening. Actually, I want to get married. But, this is an interesting story. You should have said it in front of Mom. Because since your wife died, her only dream has been for you to be remarried. It's not like that. It's that the issue about this marriage is attached to another issue. The girl I want to marry is Fulani and also a Muslim. So tell me the part where the girl's father is an Imam? Okay, you know what? I'll go tell our Mother that her son has gone crazy. [chuckles] Um, You are my brother… you won't understand. I love Badejo very much. But wait, Brother. For God's sake. How do you expect our mother to accept a girl, whose lineage was responsible for killing our father, as an in-law? It's not like that. It's not Badejo's lineage that killed Father. Ah! But she's also a Fulani? This kind of stare you're giving me, is the kind of look the world will give our descendants. Like we are some kind of traitors. Do you think that's okay? [soft music playing] [in Hausa] What you told your brother, is it true? [in Hausa] It's true. [Badejo] What is this? [Samuel chuckles] Open it. -For you. [chuckles] -Wow. [Badejo] Books. Thank you so much. Well, you say you like to read books. The books and the phone are from the UK. -Do you know how to use it? -[laughs] Yes. Oh, sorry. I didn't meant to embarrass you. [Badejo] Alfa has one. I'm the only one who helps him to make calls when he wants to make calls. [Samuel] Hmm. [dad in Hausa] Go! Leave my farm! ‪[whimpering]‬ [tearfully] Go! Go! Come out! Go! Go! Go! [tense music playing] [people shouting excitedly] -[thud] -[man screams] [praying in Hausa] [praying in Hausa] [Badejo] Honorable. Honorable. -Honorable! -Yeah. -[in English] Where are you? -I'm here. I hope I'm not boring you. I like you, Badejo. I like you so much… and I'd love to marry you. You see, I would allow you continue schooling. Reach your full potential… to be all the woman you can be. But Gidado is the man I must marry. He brought… Five cows, remaining three. I know. What if I bring all the cows? Thirteen cows. And you return Gidado's? Won't your parents allow me to marry you? [Badejo laughs] Yeah, I don't know what they would say. But even if they agree, what about the sharo? What is the sharo? [Badejo] The sharo is the ancient -Fulani rites of marital ceremony… -Mm-hmm. in which the intended husband is flogged to test if he's worthy enough to marry a Fulani jewel. Flogged, as in beaten? To know if he's worthy? Yes. So there's no way we can work around it? No. There's no way. When we get to that bridge, we'll cross it. But if it is the only way to win you over… Would you change your religion, just for me? If I had to, yes. But why? I'm just a village girl. Badejo, the very first moment I laid eyes on you, I couldn't bear to imagine not to see you every night before… before I sleep and when I wake up in the morning. They call it love. [Badejo laughs] Please can we go back? I don't want people to see me with you. Why not? Gidado. He'll be upset if he sees me with you. [dramatic music playing] [Lizzy] You know what to do. Keep me posted. I will surely do so, madam. [sighs] [Lizzy] National Assembly. [traditional music playing] [praying in Arabic] God protect us. -[in Hausa] Welcome. -Good afternoon, sir. -[in Hausa] How are you? -I'm fine. [grunts] -Welcome. -[respectfully] Thank you. -[in Hausa] What is it, "belo"? -No wait. I speak Hausa. I have lived in Hausa land. We can speak in Hausa. [laughs] [in Hausa] Not ana ni birdun. [laughs] Okay I'm listening. But influential people like you, coming to a village like ours, is a surprise! As you know, the Fulani people gave us a quality life. -Because they gave us milk and meat. -Right. That is correct. But this are just words of wisdom... just say what you came here to say in this village. Okay, the truth is that it's a very important discussion that brought me here. This discussion is about Badejo. So what did Badejo do? I saw her and fell in love. That's why I want to marry her. Yes. I know. -You know, Baba? -Yes, I do. What an elder sees sitting down, a small child cannot see it even if he climbs up. I would not give you the permission to marry her and also, she is already engaged. Her fiancé has not completed the cattle for dowry. That was even what led to the delay of the marriage. Baba, I'm sorry. I know about Gidado and I know his intentions. But I think if I would be given the chance, I would return the cattle Gidado already brought and then make up the rest. so that I can marry Badejo. I will also participate in sharo, I mean the traditional shadi. Of all the beautiful women in the city, why do you insist on Badejo? Huh? It's because she stole my heart. You are a Christian, aren't you? That's correct. But Baba, if you agreed to marry her off to me, I'd love her, and cherish her, and value her over any kind of woman. Give her her rights as a woman, and also give her the chance to practice her Islam. So I think you wont have any problem with me being a Christian. Okay, I will talk to Gidado's parents. And Gidado. God willing. Thank you very much. [in English] So, you've agreed to do all that? -Yes I have. -And the sharo? What if you lose against Gidado? Against Gidado? Didn't you know that? He's going to perform the sharo on you. Are you serious? I'm serious. ‪Oh my God! I'm a dead man.‬ No. What have I got myself into? [sighs] Look. If you want to pull yourself out, I don't blame you. I understand. -It's my custom, not your own tradition. -Yes, yes. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I just have to withdraw my marriage proposal to you. It simply means I can't do all that. No woman is worth that kind of suffering. [laughs] I got you there! -You're wicked. -[laughs] The look on your face, though. Priceless! I'm embarrassed. You know, all along I'd known that it would be Gidado that would perform the sharo on me. -Yet you want to go ahead? -Yeah. It's worth it. I'm ready. [chuckles] I'm so worried. About what? About everything you would go through just to be with me. Badejo, you're worthy of such adulation. [Badejo] I just… don't want you to get hurt. [Samuel] Losing you would hurt me more. You see, I think you have to go back home now. Because the way you're looking at me, you're giving me ideas. [Badejo] What type of ideas? Ideas above my station. Since you've seen my father, I can be seen with you now. Oh, in that case my friend… -[chuckles] -No. It's not yet time. Anyway, it was worth a try. [chuckles] [Samuel] We're going to wait. [camera clicks] [tense music playing] [in Hausa] Wait. [tense music playing] Please before you do anything, remember I'm a member of the House of Reps. Don't you also fight in the parliament? Don't you throw fists? Didn't we hear that on the news? Huh? I'm sorry. You know we are men, we can sit and discuss, please. We cannot discuss anything! [yelps] [in Fulani] Useless man! [in Hausa] Let's go. [in Hausa] It's okay. What happened to you? It was an accident. I fell. -Sorry. -Okay. This is the Badejo I told you about. The girl whose parents killed your parent because of two cows? Hey. Do you know what they would do if they learned about your relationship? What is all this? The Fulani value their cattle over humans. John, what is wrong with you, huh? [Badejo sobs] Come, come. Badejo! Badejo! [melancholic music playing] Easy. -Take it easy. -What's all this? Must you talk? It's okay. Now when are you going back home? I'm not going home, I'm going back to Abuja. Because I wouldn't like Mom to see me like this. And you know I can't lie to her. [hisses] Hand me that. Give me the fura. Just leave it. [tense music playing] [in English] Are you Sam's friend? [in Hausa] Sam is such a womanizer. After that Fulani girl, here is another. Here comes another whore. [in Hausa] Am I the whore? [laughs] [in English] I'm sorry, madam. Please don't take it personally. [in Hausa] I'm sorry. [in Hausa] A whore? [in English] You must have no idea of who I am or you wouldn't open your big mouth to address me like that! [in Hausa] Are you crazy? [in English] But why these insults? I said I'm sorry. [in Hausa] It was just a slip of tongue. [in English] Continue to let your tongue keep slipping out of your mouth. Very soon, it will be cut out of your mouth and shoved into your ass. [Sam] What is going on? What is wrong? [spluttering] Isn't it this… thing of a man addressing me, calling me a whore! [Samuel] Don't mind him, he's my brother. [Lizzy] Obviously not cut from the same cloth. But look! It's the way she's dressed. And look, I thought… I thought she's-- But I said sorry. And I mean it. [Samuel] Lizzy, I'm really sorry. Please sit. Please. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. [Lizzy sighs] -But look, how was I to know she's Hausa? -I'm not Hausa. [sighs] I'm Ghanaian. [expresses surprise] You, Lizzy? Ghanaian? How come I never knew all this? How did you pass the selection into the House? If you're a foreigner? [laughs] Well, I'm Ghanaian from my mother's side. And Nigerian from my father's. Oh my! I didn't realize your injury was this serious. What happened? -I was careless. -Careless? I warned you about messing with these Fulani girls, didn't I? I thought I was the only person warning you. -Please pay no attention to my brother. -Who said I would listen to this goat. Anyway, do you have any food in this house? -I'm yet to call my maid to-- -That would be unnecessary. I can cook. -Lizzy… -I'm only trying to help, Sam. You see, I appreciate the fact that you came here to see me. But what you're trying to achieve cannot be forced. Well, I didn't realize being your friend was an offense, too. [tense music playing] It's not what you think. Well, you're a politician. It's whatever you want me to think. [tense music playing, door slams] ‪[Approaching car engine rumble]‬ ‪[car breaks screeching]‬ ‪-[car door slamming]‬ ‪-[car sliding door opening]‬ ‪[birds chirping, indistinct chatters]‬ ‪[car door slamming]‬ -[in Fulani] Greetings. -[indistinct Fulani chatters] [traditional string music playing] ‪[indistinct chatters]‬ [in Hausa] Welcome, everyone! Welcome, sirs, madam! [laughs] [in Hausa] How's everyone? My greetings to all. Greetings to everyone. I'll be right back. Greetings to everyone. Welcome. Greetings, sir. Hope all is well. [laughs] -Greetings. -[laughter] [in English] I didn't know you were coming. Neither did I. I was just informed last night. All the same, it's a delight to have you here. [Samuel] Ah, maybe I'll see you shortly. [in Hausa] Um, let's all go. Let's go inside. [Samuel in Hausa] I'm coming. [Chairman] On behalf of the House committee, on Land Reforms I want to welcome every one of you to this very, very important event. Yes, times are hard. We know. But for the fact that both parties are here it is a testimony to all our desire that we all want an end to this long running conflict. I will therefore appreciate it if we all approach this issue in the proper perspective. Once again, welcome. And I wish you a happy and fruitful deliberation. Mr. Bulus, please your presentation. Thank you very much. The fact is that land belongs to Zukuri I swear to God. And we have never enforced claim over the land. Simply because we are aware that the Berdus are aware that the land was ours. [in Hausa] You see, we know there's going to be problem. [in English] Now, here we are. [in Hausa] For years. [in English] What am I even saying? In fact, a decade down the line, we have been killing one another over the same land. [in Hausa] You see, we've been killing people like wild game. [in English] All we want from this community is simply to look favorably upon our own claim. Because if you take a man's land, you've taken a man's ability to talk. [in Hausa] That's all I can say. [Chairman in English] Thank you very much, Mr. Bulus. It is my understanding from Mr. Musa Adamu, of Nabardo town that Ms. Badejo has been chosen to represent Nabardo. It is on that note that I will call on Ms. Badejo to please step forward for your presentation. [in English] Mr. Chairman, Honorable members, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all state that Nabardo is a friendly, tightknit community who would rather be on friendly terms with our neighbors the Zukuris. We could sit here all day long and go into a history lesson as the Zukuris have done in order to prove that the disputed stretch of border land is rightfully ours. We could dig our heels in the sand and say that under no circumstances whatsoever are we going to concede any portion of that land to the Zukuris. But would that bring back our dead? Would that bring back the Zukuri's dead? [tearfully] We have to forge ahead and ensure that no drop of blood is further shed in the name of a piece of land that forever stands as a symbol [sniffles] of anguish and mourning to both towns. [wistful music playing] In the same spirit of "no-victor- no-vanquished" that sustained Nigeria, after the civil war, Nabardo has hence decided to concede half of the disputed land to the Zukuris. Only… We only pray that the Zukuris will extend the same courtesy to us, so that we may coexist together in the future. Thank you. [applause] [wistful music playing] ‪[everyone clapping]‬ [laughs] That was some presentation. Thank you, sir, but I was a little nervous. But you stole the show. ‪Everyone was asking,‬ ‪"Who is that Fulani beauty with braids?"‬ [Badejo laughs] [Badejo] I hope that we can all abide by the agreement. Well, in principle, it looks good. Everyone would have to go back and put what we agreed into practice, backed by the government. Then I'm happy. Are you traveling now? Um, no, I'm staying for a few days with my elder sister here in Abuja. Oh, that's fortunate. [Samuel] I hope your sister won't mind me calling you. I will inform her. Okay, I'll give you a call when I'm through. [in Hausa] Okay Because when he first joined the House, he was offered a position with a lucrative oil and gas commission. But he opted out of that and went for the penniless Land Reforms commission, rather. [Senator grunts] [Senator and Lizzy grunt] [Senator] He shows great potential as a leader and as a threat. A pity we could not induct him. -A man of principle, apparently. -Yeah, right. [Senator] By the way, when do you intend to hand over that money? I mean, the 200,000 dollars he refunded to you. [scoffs] He didn't refund any money to me. Huh? [in Yoruba] I didn't hear you. He did not? [tense music playing] [sighs] -[in Hausa] Is this not your bag? -I'm going back home. I don't understand, I thought you-- You thought I will continue to stay here so that everyone is disappointed in me like they are, you? I don't understand what you mean by that. Don't tell me you don't understand what I mean. The Zukuris whose land you're trying to collect and give to Nabardo, do you think they're cool with that? They are angry with you. Because they think you're trying to grab their heritage and give it to their enemies because you want to marry a Fulani girl. But they've already come to an agreement. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's just beyond their control, it's not really their wish. And by God, you've tarnished your reputation because a small girl has brainwashed you. John. John! [tense music playing] [Samuel] Lekan… Sorry to call you so late. Yeah, this is important. Um, yeah. It's about the vote tomorrow. Lekan, what I would say to you is to ask yourself if this tenure elongation section of the amendment is going to be beneficial to the people? I understand, Lekan, I understand. For the first time in our political careers, let's do the right thing. Otherwise, posterity would judge us harshly. Okay. Lekan, all I ask is that you reconsider your stance Please. Oh. Thank you very much, my brother. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. Good night. [gentle music playing] Ebere. Sorry to call you so late. Um, Farouk. All I ask, is that you reconsider your stance ‪for the sake‬ ‪of the democracy we so treasure.‬ Oh. Thank you very much, my brother. Thank you. See you on the floor. [groans] [Speaker] If you are in support of the tenure prolongation amendment say, "Aye." And if you're not in support of the tenure prolongation amendment -say, "Nay." -[all reps] Nay. The "Nays" have it. -[Lizzy] He's bold! He's bold! -[Senator] That's okay! ‪[indistinct chatter]‬ [Samuel laughs] -[Senator] It's okay. -[Lizzy] This is supposed to be easy. [Wenike] My sentiments exactly! Look, what the hell happened? I thought you people had the numbers to pass the bill. We had the majority. -Yesterday-- -Yesterday, what are you talking about? Senator, you should know! Twenty four hours is a long time in politics! [Senator] Then the Speaker is to blame for this. -[Senator] He betrayed us. -[rep] No, not the Speaker. He played his part making sure the bill was read on the floor, throughout the constitutional amendment. [rep] Just to make sure that the tenure prolongation system is not considered! How was that allowed to happen? -Huh? -You know we had the majority in the bag but overnight a few calls were made and some minds were changed. By whom? [Senator] How could one man turn the tide of an overwhelming majority? [Wenike] Senator, a man with conviction can move mountains! -If only he has the desire -[Senator] I see. We severely underestimated the Patriot. At your own peril! The cabal does not tolerate failure. They want a head to roll. One of your heads will equally suffice. But I will leave that to your better judgement to decide whose head should be presented on a platter. Good day! [Senator] Wenike, come! Come here! [Senator] Just come. What about the money? -[Senator] What about the money? -[Wenike] The money was handed over -[Wenike] to Elizabeth. Senator Elizabeth. -[Senator] You're sure? -[Senator] Elizabeth? -[Wenike] Yes! Who gave it to, er, Samuel. ‪-[Senator] And he got it?‬ ‪-[Wennike] Definitely! He collected it.‬ [Senator splutters] What about the money? Who gave him the money? [Wenike] Kosoni gave him the money. Alongside Elizabeth. -[Senator] And he collected it? -[Wenike] He collected the money! [tense music playing] [Badejo] The sharo. I wish you would not have to go through with it. I'm just scared for you. Badejo, I'm scared… for you. I'm really scared. -[traditional drums beating] -[woman ululating] [tense music playing] [traditional flute music playing] [in Hausa] Brother. [in Hausa] Yes. [dramatic music playing] [in Hausa] Brother. This oil am rubbing on you will not stop the pain of the beating you will receive. But I'm sure it will alleviate some of it. [sighs] Thank you. How's mom? Honestly, I think… you've lost your mind. Even though I see, indeed the girl is beautiful, -and brilliant. -But her intelligence didn't make her to stop you from performing the sharo. This is what makes me think, brother, that you're out of your mind. [dramatic music swells] [crowd cheering] [drums beating] ‪[drum beats escalate]‬ Look at me, my love. During the sharo, the way you're looking at me now, is the exact way I want you to look at me on that day. Whatever happens. don't look away from me. That is how I'm going to draw my strength. You hear me? -[haunting music playing] -[mouthing] -[thud] -[grunts] [Samuel grunts] ‪-[thud]‬ ‪-[Samuel grunts]‬ ‪-[thud]‬ ‪-[Samuel grunts]‬ ‪-[thud]‬ ‪-[Samuel grunts]‬ ‪-[thud]‬ ‪-[Samuel grunts]‬ ‪[grunts]‬ -Come here, I know you speak Hausa. -Yes [softly] I know you love Badejo. Badejo is mine. [Samuel] Okay, let her complete her education. [in loud voice] You may beat me from morning till night, but you would not succeed. Answer me. Badejo will live in my home only. She will not go back to school because education will make her disobedient. [Gidado] She must sit at home and learn our tradition. [softly] You're missing the point. Badejo's education will benefit you. My wife will stay at home. [Gidado] I will not let her go to school. [Samuel] If you agree to let her continue her education, I will let you succeed today. And if not? Between the love that makes me stand here, and the hatred you have for me, you won't be victorious over me. The love is more than the hatred you were using to beat me. Alright. Badejo will go to school. But I would not like you to be seeing her. I promise. Do you also promise to let her continue her education? God's willing, I would allow her. Before, you were beating me like a woman. Now, I want you to beat me like a man. Beat me like a man!
